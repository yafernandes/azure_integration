380131	A great mixture of sweet and sour.  These are not sour-balls, but rather a lemon-flavored hard candy that starts out sweet, and finishes slightly sour with a continuing hint of sweet.  I love the way the taste changes a bit from beginning to end, leaving you ready to try another!
135382	This coffee looks great and this coffee sounds great, but it does not taste great!  It had several  off notes to it.  It was weak and bland.  Was it roasted properly?  Bleh, skip this one.
389656	I really like the Probars, except the calorie count was too high.  The Halo bars have few calories and I like the flavors.
548281	I really did not like this tea. i general love chamomile tea and drink a lot of different brands  but this one has a strong honey flavor that totally overpowers chamomile.
455073	"1.  Didn't taste how I expected it to.<br />2.  Didn't taste that good to me.<br />3.  Had an aftertaste that I didn't care for.<br />4.  Not horrible god awful, eeew I have to go throw-up bad, but certainly not delightful or enjoyable in a way that I'd go out of my way to ever have it again....<br /><br /><a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064HK454"""">Trader Joe's Organic Ginger Pear White Tea 20 Tea Bags Delicious</a><br /><a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HE7UDM"""">Trader Joe's Organic Ginger Pear White Tea 20ct.</a><br /><a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007SS3X5G"""">Organic Ginger Pear White Tea</a>"
410171	Unlike one of the previous reviewers, this is one of my cat's absolute favorite variety. He usually will just lick the can clean while my other cat eats the food, but this is one he truly enjoys eating.
40105	bought it because my constipation is getting seriously, my friends recommended me of this. and it really works!!!<br />it is amazing :) now i cant life without it!!
68591	One of a few items in this world that I simply can't live without.  Four cups of Morning Thunder gets me going for the rest of the day.  I've convinced quite a few jaded coffee drinkers to switch over, and every time the feedback has been nothing but positive.  I swear, if Celestial Seasonings ever discontinued Morning Thunder, I would probably be forced to take hostages.
147722	"I BOUGHT THIS COFFEE DUE TO THE RAVE REVIEWS, BASED ON """"EXTRA BOLD"""" CRITERIA. SINCE I HAVE BEEN VERY SATISFIED WITH ALL MY OTHER TIMOTHY BRAND COFFEES, I WILL ASSUME THIS WAS A VERY BAD BATCH. VERY BITTER WITH A STRONG BURNT AFTER TASTE. THREW AWAY BOTH BOXES, AFTER TRYING SEVERAL OUT OF EACH BOX. WILL NOT BUY THIS ONE AGAIN BUT WILL CONTINUE BUYING OTHER TIMOTHY WORLD COFFEES."
103200	I love this sugar-free product I have purchased 12 bottles for my morning coffee.  I have also purchased 6 bottles of not sugar-free and gave them as gifts.  I originaly purchased this at a warehouse store but they no longer carried this produce and found it on Amazon.  Yeah!
419948	This product gives your cats the variety that they crave and need all in one case.  It beats ordering several cases and having to open each one up seperately.  The cats absolutely love this catfood and it's healthy for them as my cats are very healthy and have been eating these for a long time.
163833	When we couldn't find these in our local grocery store anymore, we were very glad to find them available through Amazon. these are light and delicious and a true treat!
498872	The Arizona Vanilla Company sent me very rapidly the finest Tahitian Vanilla beans along with very useful general information concerning Vanilla. As soon as I run out of Vanilla beans I will order from Arizona Vanilla Compay again.
506605	Pancakes tasted good but I just couldn't get mine to rise nicely following recipe exactly and modifying some.  So far the best pancake mix I've bought has been Uncle Buck's from the Bass Pros store.
493269	Of all the K-Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.  Of course, it is all a matter of taste, but this one doesn't taste all that good.  It is not bad - it is just kind of there - like a generic coffee.  Try something else instead.
376037	"i am waiting for marmalade to discover what this contraption is..........  she scratches the sofa right next to it despite my """"showing """" her how to use it!!!  and she just eats the catnip!!!  patience???"
55553	"These look like Cheerios, but taste like they are lightly covered in molasses and honey, with a little sprinkling of tiny oat and peanut slivers--sweet, but not sugary and are not too sweet.  They are corn O's, crunchy and delicious and taste great right out of the box as a snack, or with milk.  They leave a nice taste residue in the milk too, in case you like to drink the milk after you eat the cereal out of it.  My taste buds tell me this cereal ROCKS! and will be a HIT!<br /><br />Ingredients listed, in order on the box:  yellow corn meal, sugar, corn bran, peanuts, honey, molasses, salt, whole oat flour, caramel color, baking soda, etc.<br /><br />For 3/4 cup serving of cereal only: 100 calories, 1g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 125mg sodium, 25mg potassium, 2% protein, total carbs 23g (which include10g sugar/2g dietary fiber/11 other carbs).<br /><br />Vitamin/mineral content at 10% each: Vitamins A, C, D, Zinc.<br />At 25% each: Iron, Thiamin, Riboflavin, Niacin, B6, B12, Folic Acid.<br /><br />For those with allergies:<br />""""CONTAINS PEANUT AND WHEAT INGREDIENTS, CORN USED IN THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS TRACES OF SOYBEANS, MAY CONTAIN TREE NUTS.""""<br /><br />But, if all you want to know about is the taste, then yes, it is DELICIOUS!!!"
468625	"I am so glad to see Peet's products offered for sale on Amazon!  You can't go wrong with any Peet's products.  The teas and coffees that their expert buyers search out are top quality and very often unique.  The product is always as fresh as fresh can be.<br /><br />This Pride of the Port blend is made from black tea.  This is not a strong breakfast blend.  It has a beautiful reddish brown color when brewed and it has a wonderful floral fragrance and a complex taste.  Brewed properly, one can taste many flavors.  It is very """"nuanced"""" and provides a soothing and relaxing experience.  There is no bitterness, no off or odd flavors.  It's not my favorite of all Peet's teas, but it is my favorite of those offered here.<br /><br />If you want to get the most out of your tea experience, or if you're having trouble getting your water temperatures just right, check out the electric tea kettle we use:  <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DYERBK"""">Breville BKE820XL Variable-Temperature 1.8-Liter Kettle</a>.  We love it!  It gets your water to the correct temp quickly!  And it's very safe to use."
245866	"Something is wrong with these corn flakes. They have totally changed the formula for the worse. The box says something like """"new look, same great taste."""" But in fact with the new box they have also completely changed the corn flakes. They're larger and much more tasteless now. I don't think I'm going to buy these any more unless they bring back the old ones."
95574	"These bars have 4g fiber, 4g protein, and 110 calories (25 from fat). They are pretty tasty, not too sweet, peanut butter and chocolate flavor with rice/oats, and various sweetners. Not bad for a quick snack that's not too loaded. I like them and would buy more if I can find them at a reasonable price. I chill mine in the fridge for a little extra crunch.<br /><br />I would not really call these """"granola"""" bars, myself, but they do satisfy as a quick snack."
372334	"My 2 yr old terrier mix has been eating this food since she was a puppy. She loves it & we love it because since switching over to this her skin is no longer pink and itchy! HOWEVER THIS SELLER IS TERRIBLE....Placed order for """"just a wee bit"""" dog food. In-stock item was estimated to be delivered a week later. Well a week later when I was supposed to have received my order I instead received an email from amazon stating they could not give me tracking info because seller had not confirmed that the item had yet been shipped! I contacted seller asking when I would be receiving the order and they did not reply! Meanwhile I ran out of my dogs food and I had to drive all around town looking for a store that carried this brand! (hard to find in my area, which is why I usually order online...usually through amazon from ProbioticSmart, but I tried to save a few bucks with PetcareRx...never again"
318846	My cat has gingivitis, and he's only 2. My vet prescribed fancy expensive food that you can only get from a vet. I did some research, and this stuff is made by the same company, with a nearly identical ingredients list. While i was mixing in his old food with this stuff to acclimate him, he'd pick out the new food until he ate it all, leaving behind his purina!<br />As far as helping his gingivitis, it's helped a little. The plaque has gone down considerably, but the gumline is still reddish. He really loves this stuff, so I'll probably buy this again.
414003	The first time I tried this I thought, wow, this is great! It's as satisfying as eating regular potato chips, but sweeter and presumably healthier. So had I written the review then I would have given it 5 stars. The reason I hesitated was that I took it with me to work, and the more I tried it, the more I began to question the sweetness. There's no question that sweet potatoes are slightly sweet, but I felt it only fair to let readers know that they might find this product to be TOO sweet. Hence the reason for the 4 stars. It is still quite good, but if you find sweetness to be cloying, you might not like this product for long. But all in all, I would still recommend it.
537173	I live in NYC and you can buy these bars anywhere, however they can range up to $3 per bar. this is a great value if you enjoy these bars. By far the best bar I have ever eaten. Great flavor and consistency!
408349	Nestle makes some seriously lousy cocoa. If you can taste any cocoa or mint in this bland product, you don't have a human tongue. The drink you're supposed to enjoy smells exactly like bales of hay. And twenty seven clams? Does it come with shares of stock in the company?
213335	This Cat food is very delicious that my cat loves the product. Every time I open the pouch, my cat will come wanting to eat it. Please try this product with your cat if you have not done so yet. It is good for cats that are picky eaters.
456322	a lot of the things you give up with a gluten free diet is the TEXTURE of foods you used to love.  The spongy, slightly chewy moistness of a decadent chocolate cake is missing out of most box versions.  This one does not disappoint!<br /><br />I am buying a case.  It's that good.
473799	My wife absolutely adores this cocoa. Very easy to make, just hot water which for her is a plus.<br />She prefers this over Ghiradelli.
453824	The Heart Healthy Mix has all the best nuts - no brazil nuts!!<br />If you use the subscribe and save option,  you will get three cans of 11.5 ounces each which is larger and much less expensive than those available in regular stores.
261572	NOW stevia is the best I have used so far. I use it in many things...food and drink. The only way you will get an after taste with this product is if you use too much. It takes very little to sweeten food and drinks.
374620	I was looking for a great vegan breakfast bar to grab in the morning on my way to work and these cookies could not have been more perfect. Filling, delicious, and easy to grab on-the-go, I will definitely be a repeat customer!
356353	"This is a 2 fold product and you must be aware of this. It is great at making me drowsy before bedtime but it is also a stool softener! So...you need to experiment with how much you need/can take comfortably. I call it my cheese to magnesium ratio! It is a great product and I use it a lot...just with care. One rounded teaspoon in very warm water before bed seems to be """" my level"""". Great product and service."
531591	So, I do A/B tests.  You know, like buy bar A and then bar B and then eat 'em both.<br /><br />YEARS of doing this shamelessly has led me to become a regular purchaser of Chocolove's Pure Dark.  The 55% one.<br /><br />I don't care much for their other bars -- they're just so-so -- but DANG! the Pure Dark is crazy-good.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.  Don't just buy this bar.  Buy this bar and then buy ten other chocolate bars.  It's in the name of science, it's okay.  Take all your bars, break them up, then try them all.<br /><br />Yeah, that chocolate that keeps evolving and coating your mouth with subtlety and wizardry?  That's this one.
480465	These chips are delicious. The chips arrived early which worked out perfect for us. My husband came home for a two week vacation from Afghanistan and he loved the chips.  The chips are not greasy like chips in the US.  I will definitely be purchasing these chips again soon.  We are hooked!
204060	I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.<br /><br />After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong. Probably on the advice of their attorneys.<br /><br />You don't need to take my word for it, please read up... http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/canidae.html
223934	I picked this up at my local farmers' market and it's wonderful! I got some dipping spices from the same vendor. I brushed the olive oil on a gluten free pizza crust, added the spices and some fresh garlic and black pepper. I cover that with sliced tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. SO good!! I'll definitely be purchasing more!
279553	there where plenty of times we had to eat out...but...then came mae ploy sweet chili sauce...now we can eat in whih the same flavor, exciting taste as being at one of the favorite restaurants!!!
15167	Great syrup.  Tastes really good. I actually saw this same syrup for $35 at the health food store... So I think its a good deal, too..
71679	It's not marketed as including conditioners, but my hair feels like it does after using a conditioner.  So if you have fine, thin hair, you may not want to use this, as conditioners will weigh your hair down.<br /><br />I like it.  A little bit gives a lot of lather.  The scent is clean and pleasant, not perfumey.  It's too early to tell if it will really strengthen my hair.  I'm doubtful, because I'm older (67) and my hair has been thinning for years.<br /><br />I don't see that my results are much different from my regular shampoo (Pantene), but I'll probably switch.  It does make more lather than Pantene, so I'll be able to use less, and I like the light conditioning.  The ingredients list several natural oils, so maybe that's where the conditioning comes from.<br /><br />Five stars because it lathers nicely, rinses clean, and smells good.  There's not much more to ask from a shampoo.
198859	"Been a Spam fan for over 40 yrs. & thought the Bacon Flavored version would be something different. Sorry to say that it just didn't have any, or very little, bacon flavor. Tasted like a can of regular Spam. Called Hormel Customer Service to voice my concerns and got a curt response of """"we can't satisfy every customer's tastes"""", end of conversation. Thought they'd be a bit more receptive to a long time customer's comments but they weren't. If you like regular Spam you'll like this, just don't expect much of a Bacon flavor."
272231	I have 2 brothers that are cats and they have had this food on and off their whole lives they love it.  It's healthy and at times hard to find at stores so I prefer to order it online.
375672	With the summer heat, a cool drink it what hits the spot.  You could drink something like Snapple, but at such a lower cost and just as good (if not better) are these Crystal Light Drink Mixes.  The Strawberry Orange Banana is a winner!
167362	These snack bars are part of KIND Healthy Snacks range of whole nut bars made with only 5 grams of sugar and no artificial ingredients. I tried the Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when I unwrapped my first bar was that it seemed to rain bits of dark chocolate. There was still plenty of chocolate left on the bar, but there were a lot of chocolate crumbs on the piece of paper in front of me. I am very glad that I was not sitting back when I opened this, as I would have had a lap full of chocolate!<br /><br />The second thing I noticed was the taste. The bar is quite, quite yummy - tasting of almond, peanuts and walnuts, with a nice shadow of cocoa, and periodic flashes of sea salt. In this respect the bar is a home run!<br /><br />The third thing I noticed was the calorie count. A Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt bar has 200 calories, with 140 calories coming from fat, and it has 16 grams of carbohydrates. As far as I am concerned, this does put the bar in the candy bar range, which is unfortunate.<br /><br />So, I would say that this is a delicious, all-natural snack bar, but it is definitely NOT a low-cal snack. Also, beware of opening one of these when wearing dress clothes!<br /><br />(Review of KIND Nuts and Spice Bars Dark Chocolate Nuts and Sea Salt)
366106	These things are great!  I don't like the granola-like crunchiness of most oatmeal bars, but these are soft.  No high fructose corn syrup or other unnatural, unhealthy stuff.  Can't say enough good things!
435616	I love pumpkin, my dogs love pumpkin.  I quite often roast my own, but I need back up cans now and again.  Libby's has disappeared from stores.  This stuff is the only brand ANY store is selling.  It tastes like dirt.  It really does.  There is no fresh pumpkiny flavor.  It is also watery, which changes how pie and cake recipes turn up.  Finally, I gotta wonder-if LIBBY'S pumpkin harvest dried up, where are these guys getting theirs from? A mystery
276604	"I happily stumbled upon Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies while browsing around on Amazon. I had never heard of them before. Studying the comments, I ordered the 3oz cookies, two packages of double chocolate chunk and one of candied apple. They arrived in a flash! Both flavors are excellent but I am a dyed-in-the-wool chocolate aficionado, so those are my favorite treats. I have been looking at other so-called """"diet cookies"""" and """"breakfast bars"""" since my boxes arrived. I now know that I am getting the best cookies, the best value and the best breakfasts that I have ever known! Would that my mother had been able to buy these during WWII--I could have escaped the horrible Spam, the too-crispy eggs and the watery mush.<br /><br />Erin, I am so glad I found ye!"
221933	OK, I like a little richness. These nuts have a flavorful salt taste, but are almost too dry to get down your throat.
566659	You can use 2 or 3 bags and add a couple of plain tea bags for terrific flavored iced tea.  These teas are not weak in flavor; you will know for sure it's raspberry!  Probably the best fruity tea ever!
211559	"""""I am very impressed by SuperOlive and will consider using them exclusively for all future purchases of Frantoia Barbera Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The Olive oil arrived well packed, in excellent condition, and in a very timely manner. This is one of my favorite olive oils and I have bought more than 10 bottles over the years.  Very nice."
108579	When I ordered this product, I had no idea they had changed the formulation. I sure wouldn't have ordered 8 tubs if I'd known... Anyway, the texture is completely different, it's gritty, the flavor is less sweet, it has more calories, less fat, it's made out of tofu instead of soy beans... There is nothing that is the same! I will use this product until it's gone because I don't like wasting food, but then I'll be in the market for something else!
86159	My two terrier mixes (20 lbs. and 32 lbs.) love to chew, and their paws-down favorites over the past five years have been Nylabone Dental Dinosaurs. We go through 2-3 sets per year and have have no problems, with the exception of an occasion bit of gum bleeding (very slight) when someone gets a bit carried away. Well, that, and having to confiscate the toys when we're trying to sleep, since their chewing enjoyment is a bit too noisy for nighttime!<br /><br />After months of use, I take the worn down toys away and replace them, and I regularly check to make sure there are no sharp edges or larger parts that look as if they could break off and be ingested.<br /><br />If you have a dog that loves chewing, I've say to give them a try, at first with supervision. If your dogs are like mine, these toys will offer many hours of entertainment and cleaner teeth to boot.
229865	Got this for a kitten who has had diarrhea for 7 months. We had tried four other foods--Two science diet from vet, two that were free of soy, corn or wheat; none worked. He had been on antibiotics+Benebac, prednisone, an anti-inflammatory that is also a chemo drug (kinda scary) and had surgery to see if he had cancer. This seems to be working! Still don't know WHAT he is allergic to, but this food seems to be good for him. My other cat eats it fine, too.
125994	This gum tastes exactly like apple pie, and the flavor lasts and lasts, compared to other gums. It's just the thing to satisfy a sweet tooth. The only problem is that it's too hard to find. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this gum!
151652	This is the best boullion I have ever used.  Knorr is a great company.  Their Onion soup mix is to die for.  I use this in all kinds of cooking when stock is not available and in special recipies.
170706	While it may not look like much initially, I am very satisfied with the amount of shine the silver dust gives with mixed with some vodka and applied on pastillage. Made quite a difference for the look of a birthday cake i'm making. Item arrived in a timely manner and is well-packed.
465082	I got such a great deal on these when I ordered them. I only hope that they bring them back soon!!!
140045	I was sorely disappointed in these cookies.. They are pretty tasteless and damn hard too.. I wouldn't buy them again and I've certainly tasted much better low-cal cookies.. I definitely recommend saving your money, folks..
294130	If you've had these cookies already - no one needs to sell them to you. I would just recommend that you keep them in the freezer. That way they're sort of hidden from you (and others) but for some reason freezing them brings out the taste and consistency of the chocolate. Try it!
273480	I ordered these cupcake toppers for my daughter's birthday party. I thought they would probably be really small for the price, but they were big! They are super cute on cupcakes! And the shipping was really fast!
258752	** Update 11/05/2011 **<br /><br />I sent an email to Twining to also point out the problem to them. They replied to thank me for taking the time to bring the problem to their attention. They indicated they had addressed the issue and said they wanted to make things right for us, which they did.<br /><br />They sent a package with a selection of teas in a beautiful wooden box and also some boxes of the k-cup English Breakfast tea and a personalized letter from Monica, Twining's Customer Relations Representative (was not a canned letter response) again thanking me for taking the time to make them aware of the issue.<br /><br />I must admit I was very pleasantly surprised by Twining's gester. I just didn't think--or expect--a corporation would respond in such a personalized way to acknowledge an issue and to want to make things right the way they did. Bravo to Twining for understanding their customer-base is made up of individuals just like me that warrants a personal touch when things aren't quite right with a product.<br /><br />I can report I have not had the same problem with the new k-cups Twining send us and so it appears the problem has been resolved. As such, I have raised my rating from a 1 star to a 4 star, still withholding 1 star for the original issue. I will now return to purchasing the new red top English Breakfast tea k-cups.<br /><br />*********************<br /><br />Recently poor seals between the plastic part of the k-cup and the foil seal on top of the Twining English Breakfast Tea K-Cups have plagued us with tea leaves in the tea and overflowing tea leaves into the top of the holder requiring clean up just about every time.<br /><br />At first we thought it was our Keurig coffeemaker having a faulty seal and replaced it even though we'd only had the previous one for less than a year. However, upon purchasing a new Keurig we experienced the exact same thing right from the start. Of course, we then wondered if we'd bought a second faulty coffeemaker. That's when the light bulb went on and we realized the problem didn't happen with other k-cups--a different brand of tea, coffee, hot chocolate, etc--just the Twining brand English Breakfast Tea regular k-cups.<br /><br />It's a shame because we've been ordering and drinking Twining's English Breakfast Tea K-Cups at least a year or two now and it's only been the last two bulk batches we've ordered that have done the exact same thing. And, it's not just from one of the boxes. We've opened and tried k-cups from some of the other boxes and the same thing happens.<br /><br />The fact that it has done the same thing with two separate Keurig coffeemakers, it doesn't happen with any other brand or flavor of k-cup beverages, and it only happens with Twining English Tea K-Cups from different boxes from two different bulk orders pretty much narrows it down to the Twining English Breakfast Tea K-Cups themselves.<br /><br />I hope someone at Twining--we'll also leave the same feedback on their web site--will see this review and resolve this apparent and repeatable problem. Until then we're going to switch brands. Too bad because we've still got 6 boxes of the offending tea k-cups but having to strain tea leaves out through our teeth and having to keep cleaning tea leaves from the top of the coffeemaker holder isn't an option.
468692	"After watching a popular health show on TV recently, I decided to order cactus jelly for its health benefits. I did not find much flavor in it. Perhaps the actual """" cactus"""" flavor IS super sweet, or maybe cactus just has little flavor.  I have not compared this brand with any other, similar product, so I cannot say if this is a good or bad representation of what cactus jelly is like. I read an article that described the flavor of prickly pear cactus to """" cold green beans"""", so maybe sweet and bland is better than a green bean taste on my toast! I also doubt that there is as much healthy stuff in this once it is turned into jelly. I will seek a different product in the future."
383300	Maybe it's just me, but I have used this extract in my oatmeal (same amount as McCormick extracts) and I can't taste any flavor at all.  Very disappointing.
6650	This drink is a nice blend of juices (mostly orange) and carbonated water.  There are no other ingredients.  It has a decent amount of natural sugars from the juice, so it is not a low-calorie drink.  I thought the balance of flavors and sweetness was quite nice and would definitely buy again.
391450	I was very pleased with the handling by iGourmet: the wedges of vacuum-packaged cheese arrived in a box with cold packs so they were still chilled (not a worry in winter but good to know if ordering during the summer months).  Vasterbotten cheese is to DIE for; it's beautifully aged and slightly salty like sharp cheddar, but with a savory taste all its own.  It's perfect when paired with dark sea-salted chocolate, in a sandwich, or just nibbled on all by itself.  We ordered four 8 oz. wedges and with great reluctance gave three of them away as Christmas gifts.  This cheese is made in only one locale in Sweden, in the Vasterbotten region (it's what they're famed for, amongst other things), and there's only so much of it produced at any given time.  You may have to sign up for an email alert letting you know when it's available, but believe me, it's worth the wait!
305067	I discovered this at a local grocery store.  I really liked it, and bought many of the expensive four-packs there until I discovered it on Amazon.  The subscription deal is great, and it shows up right on time.<br /><br />Like some other reviewers have mentioned, if you don't like cherry flavored drinks then you will not like this--it is very cherry.  Lightly carbonated.  Sweet.
350390	"This brand was carried by my local supermarket until just recently.  Now, it is no longer on the shelves and is replaced by another brand.  Big disappointment.  Thank goodness I purchased the last few boxes when it appeared as though they were going to stop carrying it.  I shall be purchasing it though Amazon in the future as I do other gluten free products that Amazon carries.  Well, now to Lundberg's pasta.  It is great.  I have tried other brands but none ever were as palatable as this brand.  Not hard and """"dry"""" like so many others.  I recommend it."
95769	I use the Torani sugar free flavorings in all types of Protein drinks and different recipes. Since having Gastric Bypass it is an added benefit for flavor.
175719	These pancakes are wonderful.  My husband & I put blueberries in them to make them even more wonderful.  I haven't been able to purchase this here in Charlotte, so I always buy it from Amazon.  We'll never be without a box!
171106	This is 2.5 oz larger than what you can find in pet stores and less expensive. Shipped day the it was ordered and arrived 2 days later with prime.
148170	I grew up in Britain, where kippers - smoked herrings - were a common breakfast food.  Wishing to make kedgeree, a anglo-indian dish featuring smoked fish, including kippers, I shopped around and, based on the Amazon reviews, bought this product.  The fish that I received may have been smoked but they were then packed in oil to reverse the effect of smoking.  The result is an overly-priced version of sardines in oil.  This product is a travesty of the art of producing smoked fish, particularly kippers. That said, please buy this product if you like relatively tasteless, oily cans of dubious fish.
271634	I was in Istanbul last year and discovered the wonders of smooth, full-bodied Turkish coffee.  In my haste, I brought only one package back that I found at the Spice Market.  Once we tasted the coffee; we loved it.  Better than anything in the US.  As you can expect, we finished the small package very quickly so I decided to research the product and found it on the Internet.  It's the exact coffee from Istanbul!  Bought 3 canisters and have been so enjoying it.  The benefits -- I am allergic to caffein but have no problems with this coffee (though it is caffinated).  I have served it to many people including others who stay away from caffein and they have all enjoyed it as well.<br />This coffee is so smooth and flavorful and I am very picky about coffee especially when it's bitter (ugh).  It's a great product and I am glad there is a US importer for it.
109138	The 4 stars is so you are not disappointed with the lettuce, it's pretty soft and limp although tasty!
490118	"<a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DJNMQ"""">Best Buddy Bits-Cheese Flavor 5.5 oz.  package</a>. This treat contains garlic powder which is toxic to some dogs according to my Vet. My dog as well as a relative's dog became violently ill after eating these treats. We both ended up with $ 400 Vet bills. I contacted the manufacturer, Exclusively Pet, Inc. months ago but I never heard back from them."
295456	Great soda from Hansen's, offered in health conscious way. Aspartame has caused health issues before, so an aspartame-free soda is very beneficial. Just as important is flavor, and boy does this taste good! It delivers what you expect out of a soda - flavor without a syrup aftertaste.<br /><br />In one word: refreshing.
239425	I feed my baby organic baby food from several different brands.  I must say that Sprout tastes the most like real table food.  If you look at the ingredients, you can tell that a lot of thought is put into making these taste like real food.  Plus, they are extremely filling and nutritious.  I have tasted this one, and if salt were added (of course I wouldn't want that in my baby's food), it would taste like a very delicious canned soup.<br /><br />If these are available locally, I would suggest buying one pouch of several different varieties before investing in 12 pouches of a flavor that your baby may or may not like.  My local grocery store carries them as well as Walmart.<br /><br />ETA:  I just noticed that amazon doesn't list the ingredients.  The ingredients for this flavor as well as all of the others can be found on the Sprout website.  I will copy them here.<br /><br />Organic Ground Chicken, Filtered Water, Organic Yukon Gold Potatoes, Organic Corn, Organic Peas, Organic Cream (organic cream, carrageenan), Organic Carrots, Organic Onions, Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Organic Garlic, Organic Vegetable Base (organic carrots, organic onions, organic celery, organic canola oil, organic carrot powder, organic potato flour, organic onion powder), Organic Sage.
373176	This gets me about as close to authentic indian food as i can get at home. Maybe a little too much cinnamon in it, but makes a fantastic chicken tikka masala!
110530	"This is so handy, and it has a strong, bold flavor that is ten times better then """"instant"""" coffee.  No more dishwater....real coffee taste.  Easy to carry and such a treat. Its the best alternative when I cannot get to my coffee maker.  Love it !"
371420	I had been trying to find these for quite awhile, and I was so excited to find them here on Amazon.  What a mistake....I was so disappointed to find that they are horribly stale!!! A bag doesn't normally last too long when they are fresh, but I can't even eat these.  Save your money.
481980	"My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a """"good"""" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought """"stuff"""", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!"
446045	I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)
549153	My baby made funny face and turned away every time I tried to feed her. We tasted it and surely, it was too sour to eat. I opened 3 more pouches to make sure and they were all the same taste. I think they accidentally put too much lime or lemon juice in it. Before I contacted Amazon, I went back to read others reviews, I found another customer with the same issue.
411030	At first I planned to order this time from Amazon; however, I was glad I found it in the local Walmart store, and it only cost $7.24 for one box (32 envelopes).
513287	I ordered this chai so I would have something tasty to drink in the evenings during the cold winter months. If you've ever had a rooibos tea you know they are lighter than black teas. But they are still tasty and with Numi's delicious chai spices, this is a wonderful decaf tea to add to your collection. Not to mention it's organic and fair trade. Great tea from a great company!
70996	I never knew you could by dog food at Amazon until one day I just happened to bounce upon it.  To my amazement it came right when it was promised and no shipping to top that off was a delight.  My dog is happy too because she never has to wait for her meal like in some days she did when I would run out and have to go to the store.  This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.  Boy that was disappointing.  But now I will always order her food this way.  I hope to add the cats food next time.
487427	My dog likes the Wells Pro pac Senior chicken and rice and eat's it all, so no problems with the product.
206076	I gave up coffee for health reasons, but I missed the taste so much. Pero tastes great; better than instant decaf. I've always taken  creamer in my coffee and use it with this as well. One cup satisfies my coffee cravings.
500468	Can't go wrong with the clean energy of 5-Hour. It's our caffeine boost of choice. There are many flavors and we like them all, but pomegranate is our favorite, though we always just buy whichever costs the least.
428263	Most stores have discountinued this hot sauce, it's very hard to find.  I'm cajun from Louisiana and this is the best hot sauce I ever tasted. Hope it stays on the market, I won't buy any other.
468635	The salsa itself is very tasty and if you are looking for sweet salsa without much kick, this is definitely for you.  However, despite the webpage saying this is a 12 pack, it is NOT; it is a single jar!  I can buy this in my local grocery store for $3, $2 when it is on sale. I thought I found a nice bargain here on Amazon, but alas, no.  I will not buy this again from Amazon (overpriced) but will continue to buy from my local vendor.  Salsa gets 4+ stars, ad gets 1 star.
223253	I ordered this about a year ago and have repeatedly ordered it since. Everyone I have shared it with has loved it so much they have also gotten right on Amazon and ordered it also. I mix it in my coffee, and when I am feeling particularly naughty, top it off with whipping cream. Delicious!!!!!
425667	being a health nut and watching what i eat i decided to try all the flavors of this bar.......the fruit and nut one is my favorite!!!........hard to believe they're healthy.......great for a little between meal snack.
455558	The water tastes like every other bottled water. I have no idea whether the PH of the water makes any real difference. I did not realize these bottles were going to be so huge (over 50 ounces), so it was a struggle getting them up the stairs. It also makes them somewhat bulky to use. The price seems expensive, but when you consider that these bottles are over twice the size of most bottled waters, it is reasonable.
244980	I became lactose intolerant some time ago, and it was a severe trial to have to quit drinking milk and switch to soy.  I didn't mind the taste of soymilk just to drink a small amount, but putting in on cereal or using it in recipes was out of the question.  Then we discovered Better Than Milk Soy Original.  It is not too sweet, and not too strong a soy flavor.  It's a beautiful creamy white color, and is the closest to drinking cow's milk that we've found.  Both my husband and I absolutely love it!  We don't even miss cow's milk anymore!  And buying the Better Than Milk through Amazon.com is very easy and convenient.
66468	"I purchased this hoping that it would taste like Seattle's Best Henry's Blend.  I was very disappointed.  At the time, it was not offered in whole bean form.  After looking all over for Henry's Blend, I finally settled on Ruta Maya -- which requires grinding but is so much better and less expensive than """"Level 4."""""
90593	I am pleased with this spice as it gives me new flavors to use. So far I used it as a dry rub for chicken.
179137	"Bought this paste in my local grocery store because it was the only thing they had, plus I didn't know any better.  Was making curried butternut squash bisque for the first time.  The bisque was good, but little did I know, it could have been much better.<br /><br />Because this product was so expensive -- it took a whole jar to give my bisque a mild curry flavor -- I looked to Amazon for an alternative.  Found <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EI2LLO"""">Mae Ploy Thai Red Curry Paste - 14 ounce per jar</a> and gave it a try.  Prepared the same butternut squash bisque and Oh. My. Goodness!  What a difference!!<br /><br />Try the Mae Ploy ... you will get a HUGE container for a fraction of the cost, and the taste will be better than you ever knew was possible.  Kept in the fridge, it keeps for a good long while.  But, when you taste the wonderful flavor, you'll be looking for recipes calling for curry paste.  Try the yellow and the green curry too.  Totally different tastes."
183404	This is a pleasant new addition to the Chips Ahoy! brand.  It's softer and a little smaller than the original chocolate chip cookie. Each cookie has a bit of fudge flavored choco-cream in the center.  Although it's soft, it holds up surprisingly well when repeatedly dipped in milk.<br /><br />I scanned the package looking for any mention of hydrogenated oil, but happily found no such listing.<br /><br />10 oz was actually plenty to satisfy a couple of sweet-toothed kids (and mom).  It was a rare indulgence.  It certainly doesn't taste homemade, but will satisfy on a road trip any day...
451158	I expected to receive 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 2), but just like previous customer, I got 3oz boxes, which is 2 oz (56 grams) less than it was promised. It was unpleasant surprise. So, be prepared to not get what you paid for.
45114	Before you order this, check the prices at your local grocery store.  I assumed with the subscription discount it was a bargain.  It isn't.  Even the most expensive grocery store in my area carries the same product for less!
151579	This cereal is absolutely one of my favourites, It is one fo first gluten free granola cereals I tried and I was hooked. I love the flavour and the fruit and nuts are just delicious. I just cannot believe that is gluten free, a real treat for people who want a nice cereal or something to add to a yogurt.I like also to add some nuts to this cereal, but the ingredients are of the highest quality and the packaging is really good at keeeping the granola frsh, a must buy.
11453	I've heard that some grade B Maple syrups are too strong.  Maybe so, but this stuff is excellent.  This is the second quart we've received, and the flavour is perfect.  A bit stronger than grade A, but sweet, and very pleasant to my taste.<br /><br />PERSONAL TASTE NOTE: I also like my honey straight from the hive, and unfiltered honey is sometimes a bit stronger, as well, as it has bits of pollen and comb mixed in.  That being said, I have friends who are more finicky and they like this batch of syrup, as well.
375139	2 bags to 64 ounces of water and stick it in the refrigerator - very refreshing any time of year
271912	I love the convenience of having these shipped to the door.  My family loves the product.
107659	Great teas with great flavors. I thought the bags were a little weak flavor wise, even after leaving the bag in the hot water for an additional 5 minutes, so I just started using less water. They were all great flavors except for the honey one. I'm sure this is a preference thing, but I ended up tossing or giving away the extra honey ones, because the flavor was very off. It didn't taste like honey at all, and I wasn't sure what it tasted like. Overall, great variety pack, completely recommend it if you're someone who's starting out with teas and would like to explore some flavors (like I did!).
280649	This Cereal is Great for people like Me who are Into Health and Fitness.<br />The Low Sugar and High Fiber is Great and the Taste is Amazing.<br />It stays Crunchy in Milk too!
50341	I love salt.  I love pepper.  I also love these nuts.  You will not regret purchasing these nuts if you want plenty of flavor and satisfaction.  Once you start eating them though, it won't be easy to stop.  I will probably purchase these for gifts for my family at Christmas.
199970	If you are from western NY, you know you can't eat a hotdog without this...
378331	For those who love bold coffee, Jet Fuel, is for you.  Other brands that offer bold roasts are just not as good.  I am going to see if they sell jet fuel that are not for K-cups also.  When I travel, I do not always have access to a Keurig and have to settle for coffee that is subpar.  My only complaint is the increase in price!  I used to pay $17.83 per month but over the last 3 months the amount has sky rocketed.  Not sure as to why but I imagine it is because of several reasons and one of them is the increase in demand as Jet Fuel is no longer a cult favorite and more people are starting to buy it.  If the price does not decrease I will be forced to cancel my subscribe and save subscription.
361665	I start popping a package when I can feel that wall coming on.  These are easy to open while cycling and give a decent boost within a relatively short period of time.  As always, organic is a definite positive.  Not a lot of water is needed to get these down and I haven't had any heavy stomach feelings after consuming them.  Very happy with this purchase and will get more when this case is gone.
304282	Works wonders for me when I first started taking them, after that it was harder to get that quick, long lasting buzz.  My suggestion:  Don't use everyday, drink lots of water on the side.
457130	I must say that I was pleasantly surprised when I cooked and ate the macaroni.  The elbows are larger than the traditional wheat elbow macaroni.  However, the taste is excellent, and I don't think that you can tell any difference in both taste or texture.  I made macaroni and cheese with the rice macaroni for my grandson, and he loved it.<br /><br />One thing that I did notice is that it does seem to soak up more water in the cooking process, so I would suggest adding more water to the pan than you would normally use if you were cooking the wheat counterpart.  The first time I cooked the rice macaroni, the pan nearly ran dry of liquid before the macaroni was tender.  But don't worry, it does not come out mushy.  Just be sure to observe the recommended cooking times on the package and you will have a perfectly textured pasta that tastes great.
152029	"I like Dogswell products and have purchased the """"Vitality"""" Chicken Chews before (which are actually chewy). But these sweet potato chews are hard as a rock! I seriously couldn't even chew them, it was like biting a lolipop or jawbreaker - way too hard.  My dog and my roomie's dog didn't care for them one bit.  I purchased them because they were on sale (deeply discounted) and now I know why....<br /><br />Buy other Dogswell Chews, just not these sweet potato ones..."
5958	It was bad before we open them. I saw them when we got. I did open. It had some spot green color. I did not know what it was. I was very upset. Do not buy this product.
509762	These are the best.  I use them as a meal on the go.  The Protien is high and they are yummy.<br />it is my go to dessert as well.
281165	My dogs love these, although I don't think they have ever met a treat that they didn't like. My one dog has allergies and I was glad the ingredients in these treats can all be pronounced. I would purchase these again.
318635	In the afternoon, tea is my favorite. I brew it using the medium size cup button on Keurig machine. It tastes very good. Not bitter, and not very light either. I am back  to Amazon to buy more of this brand right now. Even english breakfast  tea is different by the company who packs it. I like twinings the most.<br /><br />Try it and you won't regret it.
176375	Just received this item in the mail. It's not organic, but is listed as such. :(
544900	I loved the taste of butter chicken and the chicken curry paste was also quite okay, but I didn't quite like the biryani paste..
549926	This tea tastes the best out of any tea that I have ever tried and has helped me get through numerous colds quick and easy!
155322	After learnging the benefits of coconut oil, I decided to give it a try.  While I was shopping at GNC store, I was very excited to see the coconut oil on their shelves.  I purchased a jar, but when I tried it... that's a diffrent story.  The taste was making me want to throw up.  Instead of giving up on it, each time I would take a spoonfull, I would pull my tongue in and hold my breath, so that I couldn't smell or taste it.  Well, after one week I decided to check amazon and I found out that Nutivia had the best reviews and I went ahead and ordered it (ordered it from Nutivia website as it was a little cheaper).  What a difference ! ! ! This coconut oil is amazing... It looks, smells, and tastes so fresh.  I just started to do oil pulling [...] and I found the best benefits with coconut oil. I would recommend this product to everyone !!!
230693	By the grace of God, unlike Monster or almost any energy drink (including those horrifyingly disgusting and extraordinarily expensive shots of caffeine which carry the not-so-happy side-effect of making you get hot flashes and flush like it's a freaking rash on your face), this actually tastes palatable. In my experience of tasting energy drinks and shots, they almost invariably taste exactly like toothpaste and/or cough syrup. Not only are they disgusting beyond words and are insanely unpleasant to drink for seemingly no good reason, but they almost always have very little of the single ingredient that matters: Caffeine. Any half-educated energy drink consumer knows this is the only ingredient in the entire thing that actually does anything at all. There's 240mg per can in these, versus the usual 120mg (about the same amount of a standard cup of coffee) in other drinks of the same size, which is just not enough for people like me.<br /><br />This stuff actually tastes like a genuine raspberry soda, has a decent kick, and doesn't taste as horrible as anything Monster has ever made or any of the even more unpleasant energy shots that taste identical to concentrated cough syrup, which then, for seemingly almost everyone, give you a blast of Niacin so insanely high that it even warns you of it ahead of time, and by God, if it lasted more than a few minutes, you'd think you'd need an ambulance. And you pay a *lot* for those suckers.<br /><br />This is really the way to go. It tastes good and has a lot of caffeine, and lacks the bad things most energy drinks have. Since that's really all that matters, I highly recommend it. It never seems to get old.
319874	I liked them the first time I bought them.  Then, I bought like 6 bags and had 1 chip and just really didn't like them.  Too much of a good thing I guess.  Best to eat these with moderation.
29295	This popcorn has a good taste like the movies theaters at a reasonable price. The package contains all of the ingredients and instructions to a good eating and popping experience.<br />Although I didn't got through the whole case I bought,family and friends loved it. Nice product I'll buy from Discount Tommy soon!<br /><br />  Marcla
294767	I picked this up at a nutrition store and was impressed.  Compared to anything else I have tried, this is by far the best.  Muscle Milk compared to this tastes like a garbage chemical...
470629	Every time I open a can, my cat meows like CRAZY... He always thinks it's one of these... Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. So whenever I have soup or whatever, I give him one of these. This is the only kind of food that I KNOW he likes. And it keeps him healthy. I can tell when cat food isn't that good for him. He sheds a little more. But I don't have that problem with this and the other cat food I'm giving him now.
474034	The tea tastes great and the price is right.  It has a delightful smell<br />when the envelope is opened and when the tea is brewed.  Green tea has<br />health benefits but the green chai is much more fun to drink than most<br />green teas.
93127	"Surprisingly good.<br /><br />Very easy to make, but it did take more watching and stirring than I would have liked. A nice alternative to Hamburger Helper when you need a """"desperation dinner.""""<br /><br />The kit consists of a packet of risotto (a rice shaped pasta), a flavor pack, a pack of freeze-dried broccoli, and a pouch of Velveeta cheese. You provide and brown your own chicken, boil the rice with the flavor packet, add the chicken, add the broccoli (it looks and smells weird out of the pack), and finish by adding the cheese. The final product looks ok (only vaguely reminiscent of vomit), but it tastes and smells good. It did not taste as salty as I had expected (much less salty tasting than Hamburger Helper), but I did feel thirsty after I ate it.<br /><br />You could also make it without the chicken for a vegetarian version, or if you are feeling particularly lazy."
507803	We wouldn't use any other kind of popcorn.  It is actually BETTER than theater popcorn!  It has just the right amount of salt and butter.  DELICIOUS!
112914	My husband and I LOVE these chips! Personally I think the flavor is perfect. Try them for yourself!
523871	I made a purchase because of the rave reviews of others. After few tried out I found it lacks the typical full body aroma of sumatra grown coffee beans  which I'm so used to it. May be because it is organic therefore not so full of flavor.
320533	I had this for the first time recently while I was travelling in Greece. It's delicious fruit juice made from real fruit and it's not too sweet. it's manufactured by the Coca-Cola company and I wish they would sell it here too. In the USA we get Hi-C which has very little real fruit juice if any and they get these fabulous fruit concotions. Not fair!
552061	Several years ago, I started making homemade marshmallows for family and friends.  You'd be amazed at the simple joy that radiates from the face of a person learning for the first time that marshmallows can be made at home.  Anyway, as a special treat for a friend who  is so enamored with France that she grows French lavender in her backyard because it reminds her of her travels there, I decided to try a lavender marshmallow.<br /><br />I was able to find some culinary lavender in my local grocery store (near a pretty urban area), but it seemed so expensive.  In the end, this is about a fifth of the price of my grocery store.  Win!  When I got the package in the mail, I could smell the floral, almost woodsy and astringent fragrance that I associate with lavender (and rosemary) before even opening it.  The color of the flower buds ranged from shades of blue to purple.<br /><br />To cook with it, I dump what I need into a large bowl and use the sprayer on my faucet to put enough water in the bowl so that the flowers float.  I give it a stir and then use a small-gauge strainer to scrape the floating flowers out of the water.  Any detritus that may be mixed in with the flowers will sink to the bottom (though any stems will not - but then again, rosemary and thyme typically have some stems mixed in), so don't just dump it in the strainer.  Glean the flowers from the top of the bowl.<br /><br />As for my marshmallows, which I topped with lavender-scented dark chocolate, my friend loved them and everything I've made since (lavender lemon cookies, blueberry lavender syrup, lavender cream, lavender, thyme, and rosemary roasted potatoes, lavender butter, strawberry lavender butter, etc.) has been quite delicious.  When I need more lavender, I know where to come.<br /><br />Update:  I also wanted to mention that 1 oz. of lavender is about 1.25 cups.
419463	I'm a busy mom who normally runs on coffee, but 5 Hour Energy is a great lower calorie alternative. I don't get the shakes like I do after one too many espressos, and I can tuck one of these into my purse easily. A quick shot and I'm good to go, without the possibility of coffee stains or spills.<br /><br />I was amazed at how long it lasted as well. I was used to having to refuel my caffeine tanks around 2:30 pm, but I took the shot at 7 a.m., and kept going until 6 without a hitch.<br /><br />I may have to start buying by the case. Great product.<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGYÂ® from Smiley360.
366854	I don't know why but my dogs are not interested in these treats.  They love chewing on other brands of bully sticks but not this one.  I guess they all have their favorites like people do. They don't compare to bully sticks which are meatier and tastier looking.  But who knows, your dog(s) may like them?
345355	The Jacobs coffee was delivered quickly and without damage to the packages. Fresh coffee. I am unuble to find this in the stores and to see it online was a nice surprise.
144558	New to cat ownership. This works well. The cat is happy, the job gets done easily and efficiently. Good price and well made plastic scoop.
50205	My wife and I made this kit and it is extremely simple to make. We added 2 lbs of dextrose to the primary and aged it for 2 months. I was pleasantly surprised when we tried this on bottling day. It is sweet and fruity, plus it had the ABV that we were hoping for. I highly recommend this kit.
565043	I love these delicious peanut buttery puffs. Much better for you than the Capn's version, for sure. And I love the environmentally friendly packaging. These didn't last long enough to go bad, even in such a large quantity. But when will Amazon get them back in?!
293393	We first tried these while experimenting with GFCF diet for my son.  He is a seriously picky eater and before these cookies would only try soft-baked cookies. The cookies are small and crunchy with just a little bit of a chewiness in the middle. These cookies have stayed a part of our household even though the GFCF diet did not.
244515	This is the most flavorful salt you can imagine.  After you cook a nice thick steak and carve it, sprinkle a little of this salt on the cut side to make the meat pop in your mouth!!!  If you've never experimented with finishing salts, then this is a great starting point!
272892	I love this tea.  This has body, flavor, and is easy to brew.  Twice as good as any Lipton tea.
202925	I bought this to make Butterscotch Pots DeCreme.  It was divine!  Better yet, I'll use Dark Muscovado sugar in every recipe that calls for brown sugar.  The flavor is far superior.  A little spendy but worth the extra.
236813	Greenies are great, both my cats love them and they seem to be a bit more nutritious than other treats. But you can find the same size bag for $3 or less at the grocery store, usually. Unless yours doesn't stock them, I don't see why you'd pay $5 at Amazon for them. Even with the 4-for-3 promo you're not getting a great deal.
543391	what more can a girl ask for?  This was a gift for a friend who was missing her Scottish vacation and reminiscing about the tea.  I found it on amazon (of course!) and got super fast delivery and my friend is very happy!  Yay, Amazon!
40966	I have searched for an oatmeal that was not soupy or creamy. The key to.this oatmeal is to.have the water boiling when you add the oats. I love this oatmeal. Best I have found in my opinion.
221621	I like teas and i do drink them quite freaquently. This one is not really noteworthy. It Is somewhat on the weak side, but far from the worst.<br />I am only writing this review to tell you to shop around. Check the Twinings website. There are deals to be had!
170314	You will not regret buying these if you are a fan of ginger.  I plan on trying the ginger mango next.  They are the best ginger chews I've ever tasted.
468361	...a #2! I do eat other foods with some fiber but I think these seeds have more fiber and it definitely helps with bowel movements :D. So far, I've used it in baking (e.g. cookies, cake) and smoothies. Doesn't alter the taste in any form since the seed is tiny. As for whether I have more energy, I haven't noticed any additional energy since I've been using it.<br /><br />The pack I received has an expiration date of 2014 in case you might wondering.
89901	Shaggy dog thought this was human food, I think because of the way it looks.  The picture on the bag is pretty accurate - there are meat pieces, veggie pieces and kibble.  He seems to like the taste of it, too. That may be beacuse it is so different from his usual limited ingredient grain free foods. This food agreed with his sometimes testy digestive system,so it's a food we'll rotate into his diet from time to time.<br /><br />Here are the stats: crude protein 28%; crude fat 16% crude fiber 3% moisture 12%<br /><br />and the top ingredients: Beef, soybean meal,soy flour,animal fat preserved with mixed tocopherols, brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal ---- and the list goes on.  You might want to compare this to the food you currently use for comparison.(the first ingredients are those in greatest concentration in the food)
410692	"I bought this vanilla powder in Whole Foods, I assumed that Whole Foods sell best products. Unfortunately WH also sell GMO, but they pay me money back even for empty bottles of this vanilla powder.<br />I do not recommend to buy this vanilla powder, especially for children and young adults, because maltodextrin is made from GMO (genetically modified organism).<br />Nielsen-Massey company also give me false info over the phone that they do not use GMO.<br />Here is part of document I received from Nielsen-Massey company by email:<br /><br />""""To whom it might concern:<br />Regarding MALTRIN M100 and M510 maltodextrin, these products are processed from some GMO raw materials. These products will typically test negative for GMOs by PCR method. Those products will not meet EU labeling regulations as a non-GMO...."""""
519404	I remember eating these a kid and i loved them so much. I have been trying to find them for years and finally i found them on amazon. These pops are so addictive once i eat one i cant stop eating more.
429076	We received our Bob's Red Mill Cranberry Beans quickly.I soaked them overnight and rinsed.I added chopped onion and olive oil.Also, I added a cleaned,large potato,pierced.After beans are cooked,dispose of the potato.(If beans bother the system the starch in the potato helps.)The beans were delicious.We made cornbread and hash browns,yum,yum.I also like to mix navy beans with cranberry beans.The cooking time is about the same and delicious.<br />Try these,you won't be disappointed.  NOTE:I stored the extra packages of cranberry beans in the freezer to keep them fresh.
507768	This is wonderful toffee.  A bit tacky, not too sweet, very creamy.  The hazelnuts give it a bit of crunch and add flavor.
297037	I reall love the chocolate raseberry kcups I was getting them through the  company but they are cheaper through amazon thhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleanks
237568	I had never had veitnamese style coffee before purchasing this item. It was wonderful the item works great clean easy and was shipped fast. Would recommend to friends and other coffee lovers.
293287	I'm a big fan of dark chocolate and really like the Extreme Chocolate Mini Cookies.  I've also had Pamela's Products Ginger Cookies and they are very good as well, however the chocolate are the best!
257588	"This body wash lathers up well, but you need to use a good amount; it isn't concentrated.  The scent is similar to """"<a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VOLLG2"""">English Leather</a>"""" Aftershave.  The bottle is designed well, easy to use while showering."
148477	I received medium roast. Didn't receive the correct coffee shown on picture. Disappointed by this. I suppose ill try as its a lot of my trouble to return
211717	I love the Munchies PB crackers like the first reviewer.  They are the best on the market.  I can only find the multi-pack boxes at Walmart but they are usually sold out--though they do sell them by individual packs on the checkout aisle. I wish Amazon carried the boxes cheaper.  Why so expensive here when you can buy a box at Walmart for $1.99?
45180	This rice has a good flavor. I keep them on hand when I need a quick side dish.  Nice amount of spices.
517108	The soup is delicious.......the price is not!<br /><br />I purchased an 8 pack of this soup for under twenty dollars delivered about 6 months ago direct from Amazon. Unfortunately it looks like we now have to go through a reseller to obtain this product and pay an inflated price, hence the one star rating. I'm down to my last can but I cannot bring myself to pay this much for soup!
53018	Excellent!  Best chocolate truffles I have ever had.  I received them as a gift from a student.  I have to admit I gave a lot away (there are 80! in the box) but that was only because I found them very addicting and didn't want to imagine what 80 truffles would do to my hips (because I WOULD have eaten all 80 - they are that good!).
507825	These are pretty tasty, and I don't like most nutrition bars.  I eat them for an early morning breakfast.  They don't taste too sweet, yet not overly healthy either.  Just a really yummy-peanutty flavor.
526234	These little trinkets are hard to find but quite yummy!
354774	My absolute favourite! When it comes to these gummy treats Bissinger is 5 Star! Superior flavour!  Best advice buy plenty. You won't be able to share.
487558	This is the best coffee ive tried yet.<br />I Don't even like Folgers.<br />This says something.<br /><br />I have a love for caramel and it is taste-able.<br />The only coffee I dont use milk or sugar on too!
128862	Gummies were fresh and yummy, well packaged!<br />Only wish apo shipping were an option, I had to reroute<br />to another place to get here.
154155	I bought a bottle of Master Martini Gold Dirty Martini mix from the local liquor store.  I tasted awful...like chemicals.  They should be ashamed to call it Dirty Martini mix.  When I received the Dirty Sue Dirty Martini Mix, I had my fingers crossed...and I was not disappointed.  It has a real olive taste! It is the best dirty martini mix that I have ever had! It only has 2 drawbacks---1)it isn't available in local stores and 2) the bottles aren't larger.  Can't wait until Amazon carries the larger bottles.
537573	Sylvia's cornbread is very rich unlike others, and very simple to make!!!!I shared w/family and friends, everyone loved it!!!!!
441345	My only complaint is how long it took to ship from the UK to the United States. But, that's not Marmite's fault. I am a recent devotee of Marmite, having only found out about it, and that I could get it here a couple months ago. After devouring 2 bottles of the regular, I had to order this. Man, am I glad I did. I mean Marmite is good, but if I am going to pay a premium for it anyway (125g jar here for $6), then $15 for a jar twice the size, with twice the taste is worth it to me. Thanks for making this available to me.
264767	Great value for bully sticks, which are usually pretty expensive. Arrived on time with no issues and our pup loves them.
359121	I thought this may be a little hot for me so I mixed a few teaspoons with a little mirin and sesame oil.  Very, very good.  However, I tried to order 5 more and the shipping was more than the product so I cancelled the order.
512064	I really like the Nature Valley Cinnamon Granola Bars and have for some time.  However, I can no longer find them in the grocery stores in my locale.  The boxes of Cinnamon bars stopped being available some years ago, and recently they were no longer available in the variety pack either.  It was a pleasure being able to purchase them again.
145043	First off, Huggy's Haven change your picture! False advertising!!!!! I thought I was purchasing the old berry kix and it turns out it was the new one. For the amount of money I paid, I could have gone to Walmart and paid much less. This company charged me a ton for shipping and it was still 25 days late. I wasn't until I messaged them that the product was shipped. Don't buy anything from Huggy's Haven, they lie and they the overcharge you while they're doing it! I will never purchase anything from these people again!
108865	I received the tree in the coldest days of January and the box was left outside. I thought that under those conditions the tree would have no chance. To my surprise the tree looked great it was well wrapped and it had a warm pad that kept the temperature fairly well inside the box. The tree itself looks like the one in the picture and I'm very happy with it. I just saw that new leaves started to develop and it looks that it is going to go well.
466650	My family loves French Fried Onions. My kids will eat almost any vegetable if I sprinkle a few of these on top. Getting the big 24 OZ bag is a must.
391292	"My husband and I drink a good amount of Crystal Light powdered beverages. I was initially leery of purchasing this particular flavor but after trying <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC"""">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and finding it great, I thought I would give this one a try. In terms of flavor, I find this acceptable.  It tastes like a very mild margarita (without alcohol).  It even smells like a margarita.  While I think Crystal Light has done a good job imitating a margarita, it is not my favorite Crystal Light product.<br /><br />If you live near a Meijer, you can buy a five pack canister of the Margarita drink mix (as well as <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LGIY"""">Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini, 1.69-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC"""">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>) for about 2.79.<br /><br />If you recycle your plastics, be aware that Crystal Light sells its product in a #5 container. Unless you live in a relatively progressive place, #5 plastics are typically very difficult to recycle. Whole Foods engages in a recycling initiative to collect #5 plastics but if you don't live near one and you care about recycling, these can be a challenging item to deal with.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is a beverage that I would drink again but I don't know if I would purchase it if some of my other Crystal Light favorites were available like <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E53TMQ"""">Crystal Light Sunrise Ruby Red Grapefruit, 3.4-Ounce Unit (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005A1LINC"""">Crystal Light Moctails Mojito, 1.41-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>."
441446	Very deceptive marketing. There is sucralose in this product used to make it sweeter. I fed this to my children not realizing they had not reduced the amount of sugar, simply replaced real sugar with a chemical (sucralose). If I wanted to feed my family fake sugar I would have bought the diet oatmeal. It should clearly read SWEETENED WITH SUCRALOSE on the label and NOT LOWER SUGAR.
561423	I love passion fruit juice and this is a very good product. Each bottle makes about a gallon. It is low in sugar and low on glycemic index. Has a lot of potassium and is a natural relaxer. Makes great cocktails too if it isn't relaxing enough for you straight up! Fast delivery and great product!
31473	This is the best.  Great taste and yummy, like eating dessert.  Love it.
212679	This review is about the product the seller was great!<br /><br />I heard it was good for sleep couldn't find it local so i bought it here. It stunk up my house, taste awful. save your money and buy any other tea out there.
237777	ACTUALLY, THESE WERE BETTER THAN I HAD EXPECTED.  CAREFULLY WRAPPED AND FRESH TASTING, WONDERFUL TEXTURE, WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE TO EVERYONE.
161100	I bought this product at Yoke's in Sandpoint, Idaho, and it's fabulous. Hot, hot, black pepper flavor with a savory burn that feels good on a crisp winter morning. A real plus for me is that it has NO MSG. But the real reason why I can eat this is that it has no soy protein of any kind. Soy is an extreme allergen in certain people, like me, and frankly, has no business being in food. I salute Old Trapper for making a delicious, soy-free, MSG-free peppered beef jerky (my favorite flavor) at a reasonable price. MADE IN USA.
509832	I do not eat sugar so the sugar free Torani Surups are a go to product for me.  I make my own version of the popular Peppermint Mocha coffee sold at coffee shops.
197429	This is one of our 13 month old Samoyed's favorite chews/toys (my chow chow has no interest in it.)  Not only does he like to gnaw on it, but he tosses it all around and chases it. Caution though, I got the large bone and it has some weight to it (almost 2#s.) One time he let it drop, it bounced and hit a ceramic planter causing it to shatter! I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled up on the rawhide rings.  I've had it for five days and he hasn't managed to chew them off yet...but keeps trying!  So far, this has been an indestructible chew toy that has kept him occupied for hours.
488197	Easy to get a modified espresso bump even when I am asleep on my feet at 5:30 in the morning.
107539	This is one of my favorite k-cup coffees. Bold and assertive but smooth and without bitterness. Unfortunately it's out of stock at Keurig.com where a 24 count box sells for $13.90(for members)and includes free shipping. I considered ordering a box here until discovering the unreasonable price plus shipping of this item from this seller. Buyer beware!
94548	I love this honey mustard more than any I've ever tried. It's the only kind that is close to what they provide in restaurants. The other stuff in grocery stores taste gross. Unfortunately, I haven't found Billy Bee Honey Mustard in any stores near me. My mom has been shipping it to me from Orlando, Fl, since 1996 (first when I was in college and now that I live in LA, CA). She's had problems finding it recently so I did a google search and look what I found! I'm soooo freakin' excited! Totally asking for this for xmas!
497504	I bought these for my 2 nieces - one is 3 the other is 6. They love lollipops. These are probably the most healthy lollipops you can buy. They are 100% all natural - nothing is artificial in them. I didn't want to buy them something with a lot of added sugar - which these don't have. What's also great about these lollipops is there are a lot of flavors to choose from. My nieces love the variety and love the taste. And since this was a big container and thus there were lots of lollipops I took some for myself and I love the taste as well. There isn't a flavor I don't like.
378768	"It stinks, it's sticky-gooey-awful, and my cat loves it!<br /><br />My vet recommended """"baby food"""" for my cat when he was having trouble digesting his normal fare.  I tried several varieties but Gerber Beef & Gravy was the clear winner.  My cat likes it so much that he insists on a jar of it to start each day.<br /><br />More expensive than """"cat food"""", it beats the heck out of having to deal with kitty vomit!  Since Gerber doesn't vitaminize its foods for cats, I add 50-100mg of Taurine to every plate.<br /><br />Amazon's prices are the best!"
62663	"I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I didn't really drink tea, until about six months ago. I was drinking <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HFA3XY"""">Honest Tea Half Tea & Half Lemonade 12 pack 16.9 oz. plastic bottles</a>  - I quickly grew tired of the cost, and disposing of so many plastic bottles.<br /><br />Making the switch to tea bags, I picked this tea at random from the local grocery store, expecting it would be one of many brands and types I would need to try before finding a favorite.  After trying a few others, this is definitely the one!<br /><br />If anyone has information on the quality of ingredients, EGCG levels, etc., please reply to this review."
330360	"If you've bought the new formula of Hill's Science Diet dog food, you may have noticed an extreme fragrance.  It is unpleasant to humans, but the dogs seem to like it (if you get my drift--think, """"base of a fire hydrant"""").  This is unnecessary because the dogs liked it before and it had a tolerable dog food odor for humans to smell.  The new stuff is odiferous in a disgusting way.  I don't want that fragrance in my house, let alone the kitchen, which is where the dogs eat.<br /><br />This new stuff is probably the same as the old stuff only now you get less of it and it costs more.  Sigh.  So you pay more for less food, but at least it isn't stinky.  The dogs like it just as much as they did before.<br /><br />I hope Amazon will begin to carry this product in the large size.  We have two """"mature"""" labs, so we will always need a supply of this food.  The local pet store isn't open 24 hours and doesn't always have what we want.<br /><br />This would be a terrific item for """"Subscribe and Save""""."
235533	This tea is one of my favorites.  It's a caffeine-free tea that has a wonderful lemon flavor with a bite of ginger.  It's very refreshing and satisfying.  I especially enjoy it when I have an upset stomach.
196316	Very light tasting, and actually tastes like the fruit -- no cloyingly overly sweet syrup to detract from taste.  Gave some to my boyfriend who commented on how fresh, and natural the peaches taste.  like them sooo much I get both the peaches and fruit cocktail on autoship.
150766	Received a sample box of Ahmad English Tea in a Christmas gift basket.  When it was gone, ordered a box of 100 tea bags.  This is a nice dark and hearty tea.  And it's from England. Excellent either in the morning or for late afternoon on a winter day. Though with the shipping fee it's a bit expensive, it is worth it.  Now one of my favorite teas.  Will order again.
123004	These are the BEST chips ever!  I hate chips that are ruined by mass quantities of salt.  These chips actually taste like...wait for it...POTATO!  The only thing wrong with them is that they are so good I can't stop eating them!  Light, crisp, not greasy, and tasty.  Could it get any better?
433442	"Now, one of the reviewers of this product complained about the sugar content of this cereal by only looking at the ingredients list, which is not how to determine the nutritional value of any product (especially when the reviewer cannot distinguish between nutritive and non-nutritive ingredients). This cereal has just as many simple sugars as Frosted Flakes, but the cereal does not claim to be low in sugar. What's important about this cereal is that it offers quite a bit of fiber and vitamins/minerals (not as much as some cereals, but since I have no deficiencies in this area, I didn't mind). Also, it only has 3 times the salt of a half cup of milk which is not LOADED. A can of healthy choice soup, now that is loaded with salt.<br /><br />Now, I chose this cereal as a replacement for Frosted Flakes/Honey Nut Cheerios, which against my better judgment I continued to have every morning. I should point out that I don't drink coffee in the mornings and I don't drink soda (less than 1 a week on average). I also eat no sweets.  Simple sugars (listed as just """"Sugars"""" on the nutrition label) seem to be treated like carcinogens, while most people don't realize that aspartame (artificial sweetener in most diet sodas) really is one. If your diet is already low in sugar and you feel confident you can burn through those sugars pretty quick (since I don't drink caffeinated drinks, I need that jolt in the morning), then this is a good choice. If your diet already has quite a bit of sugar or your doctor tells you to cut down on simple sugars (or you also have a couple of cups of caffeinated coffee with sugar every morning), then go with another bran cereal without the oat clusters and syrups (which I really do not like that much). Also, if you are concerned about the total carbs, please note that a normal 2000 calories diet would include about 300g of carbohydrates (so yes, high protein diets contradict  this).<br /><br />Since taste is completely subjective, I won't put much emphasis on it. In my opinion, it tastes pretty good (but I don't consume many sweets during the day)."
14294	Far and away some of the best chocolate available. This product needs to return to store shelves for purchase anytime. Becoming harder to find. These chocolates are an old time favorite.
299043	Tim Hortons has the best coffee in the world. Maxwell and Foldgers is like drinking tar compared to this smooth tasting coffee. Thank you Canada for your 3 great exports, 1st Beer, 2nd (close 1st) Hockey, and 3rd Tim Hortons.
186861	This item is way over priced.  Don't pay $1 / cup.  You can get it around $0.60 / cup anywhere else online.  If you are paying $1 / cup, you might as well go to Dunkin Donuts.
89604	"I can't/won't feed this to my own dogs because of food allergies, and there's the mysterious """"animal fat"""" and """"animal digest"""" in this ingredient list which makes me a little nervous about which animal it came from.  Really, the ingredient list is terrible, it's a bunch of leftover food waste products made into dog food.  Beef is the first ingredient in the list, but when you add up all the forms of soy, corn, and wheat in the ingredient list, there's more junk in this dog food than beef.<br /><br />*BUT*, my family's dog is a picky eater and this Chef Michael's dog food is perfect for her because she's used to treats and flavorful table scraps (bad, bad habit that I don't approve of) and she snubs healthier kibbles.  Salt makes this kibble tasty.  With the ingredient list, this kibble reminds me of salted kinda-meaty Cheetos, complete with unnecessary food colorings.<br /><br />For my own dogs, this would be a 1-star food (honestly, I think this is junk and overpriced too for what it is), but this food does have its uses if you don't really mind what's in it and you have a picky dog and need extra flavorings to entice them to eat dry dog food."
80013	"This is a nice smooth coffee, a part of the Keurig K-cup portfolio. This is labelled """"extra bold."""" Not sure that that is the case. This has a nice smooth, albeit rather mild (and even bland) flavor.<br /><br />However, some K-cups have a harsh, almost acidic, quality to them and are not particularly pleasant. This produces a nice cup of coffee."
170086	"I usually buy wheat berries in bulk but had no other choices yesterday and bought the only brand (Nature's Earthly Choice, packaged) carried in my local market. Not only is Nature's Earthly Choice about FIVE times as expensive as buying in bulk (even from the high-end national chain store), but Nature's Earthly Choice is also more expensive than virtually all other brands. And after cooking, Nature's Earthly Choice Wheat Berries looked awful - as if they'd been totally overcooked and every kernal had exploded. (Perhaps that's because they've been turned into a """"cooks in 15 minutes"""" processed grain.) Cooking instructions on the package are almost non-existant -- no mention of medium or low flame, covered or uncovered, whether all the water was all supposed to be absorbed or what. The salad recipe on the package made it sound like there should've been no excess water, so after 20 minutes on an uncovered simmer I figured I was supposed to drain the berries. I know I'll end up feeling like I should apologize to fans (of my usual apple salad with wheat berries) about how it looks.  Very disappointing and a ripoff."
228696	These chips are quite tasty and the price is right.  Packaged very well, would buy again.
9062	"I really enjoy Wolfgang Puck's K-Cups, so far all the ones I've tried haven't left my stomach churning..and,<br /><br />this was my first time trying out the Sorrento Fair Trade Roast and purchased it on a Warehouse Amazon price deal.  I am really happy with my purchase.  The taste of the Sorrento is what I would expect of a Medium Roast = A good, smooth blend.  No bitter, acidic after taste, and leaves you wanting for more after that first cup!  (At least, it left me)! :p  It's doesn't leave you with the """"shhhakes"""" either, it has that right """"balance"""" you need with your daily cup of coffee.<br /><br />Yes, I will be getting another 24-Count of this when I am finished with this pack!<br /><br />5-Stars!"
445975	This is the only thing I use when I have the first signs of a cold or flu or just don't feel right. It's also the only thing that helps with my annoying cough that seems to last all winter. I'm not sure if I have allergies or what but all I have to do is drink a couple of cups of this tea and it settles my throat. I have a few other friends that have gotten hooked on this when they start to get sick. I haven't been able to find this tea anywhere in our town so I have to order.  It's the greatest tea.
546238	I used peanut oil for the first time at a friends house, and really liked its high smoke temperature. So I went to get some at my local supermarket and they wanted $7 for a 10 ounce bottle. I decided to wait two days and get this instead. Seems to be a great oil. Fairly tasteless (as most peanut oils are) and has a very high smoke point compared to olive and vegetable oil. For three big bottles for around $20, and you can't really beat this deal.
335668	good taste, possibly  elevates mood- this one is non-carbonated , better than the other Neuro carbonated drinks that upset my stomach.
199736	The pita chips themselves are very, very good - flavorful, but lightly salted with sea salt and crunchy.  Almost addictive.<br /><br />However, when I received my packages, they were mostly croutons.  Very, very, poorly packed and were smashed in transit.  There was no packing in the box with the chip, therefore, they just sloshed around until they were small pieces of chips.<br /><br />I would hope that next time someone orders them you'd pack them better.<br /><br />I know that I won't get an answer to this as no one there really cares as long as you get your money, and that this review is just a formality.  I did contact Stacy's about the issue and got a lot of nonsense about being fragile, hard to ship (they get shipped to stores without a problem), blah, blah, blah, ad nauseam.<br /><br />Someone, somewhere, needs to do a quality check on packing.
107903	I  bought this for a specific recipe in a book and I like the flavor so much I've been looking for more ways to use it. The cake I made with it turned out beautifully, as did the cookies. The cookies didn't even last until the next day! The flavor is mild, but very present in baked goods and custard creams.
339952	I had a hankering for some macadamia nuts so i went to Target and this is all they had. The price seemed like a real bargain now I know why.. What looks like a big ol macadamia nut is mostly all chocolate and literally a half of a small nut!!!  I don't know how they get so much chocolate over such a small piece! I guess if you like mostly all chocolate and a little nut then you might like these.
67790	These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.  They are hard to find in Vegas and are my favorite flavor. Shipping was very fast, sooner than expected.
127917	This product makes everything taste better! Fruits, veggies, nuts, sashimi, etc.! Only downside is the price, after I bought my first bottle here, thankfully a local japanese marketplace here in San Jose, CA carries it. They also carry a 12 oz version, so I got it much cheaper. But if you have no close proximity to an asian store in your city/state, then Amazon is your best choice.
366689	"I bought this and figured """"hey nothing but $4 to lose.""""  and it is not even worth that.  I opened it and it looked like chocolate cake batter and figured ok, nice.  At first taste i was like, """"not horrible... oh, there it is.""""  It has a horrible after taste that makes me think of random chemicals.  Don't buy this."
556053	This espresso is better than any I've been able to find in stores.  Imported from Italy, it is strong but not bitter.  Comes in a pack of 4 cans.  My mother used to have to bring home a suitcase of this stuff when she came back from Italy.  Now my entire family buys this from Amazon.
381113	"Tangerine Orange Tea is wonderful.  The rich flavor allows more life to the tea bags.  It makes perfect icy tea.  (I do not drink hot tea.)  It doesn't take long to make.  I love it because I don't even have to """"brew"""" it; I simply put it in my water bottle with water, stick it in the freezer, and I have icy tea in no time.  Ths tea would be perfect with an orange muffin - or any flavor muffin.<br /><br />I recommend this tea to any tea lover."
174273	My Pomeranian has a very sensitive digestive system and I could never find a food that I knew would provide him both great nutrition, taste and no allergic reaction.  Until this canned food ----- that is.  He loves it and it is made so well.  You can tell there are no fillers in it by the appearance and texture.  In fact, when you read the ingredients there is only Turkey Brown Rice and Vitamins.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about ordering this food to give it a try.  Your pooch will be glad you did.
81430	"I prefer to eat alone as it is very important to me to savor each nuance with unobstructed emotions and not be tainted by someone else's opinion (besides the unruly one named """"Dog"""" just horks stuff down.  I'm surprised he hasn't eaten the bowl by accident).  By dining on my own, I can laugh or to weep as the mood dictates, mindless of the sort of inhibitions companions might pose.<br />The first time I experienced Bellyrubs snacks, I tentatively licked up a flake and then another, and then another.  Each piece was a joy!  My shoulders relaxed.... my mind expanded.  For a moment nothing existed but me and the delicate tuna flakes.<br />Eating these treats do not disappoint, they are pure unadulterated, uncompromised joy.<br /><br />More please!<br />Steve-The-Cat<br />,,,^. .^,,,~"
530385	These were super cute. I was worried because there are better looking animal lollipops with not so good reviews online. But after getting them in the mail last night I was happy I'd placed my order. Very cute and none were broken. Can't comment on how they taste until after the Shower.
46064	I have a wrapper from a single teabag of Nummi Tarry Lapsang Souchong, and the wrapper alone smells stronger after being opened for two months than a whole 3.5 oz bag of this smells fresh. This tea only has a light smoky scent and flavor, whereas the Nummi tea had a strong pine smoke scent and taste. I know that tarry lapsang souchong should be stronger, but I'm still a little disappointed at how weak this one is. Maybe I'll just use more tea for stronger batches.
256491	I was always a white truffle fan, but added these to my wish list just cause they sounded good, they are much better than I expected!!!
305237	I typically ride about 5000 miles a year (would do more but live in New England).  I usually do a handful of pro/am races a summer (I fall into the am category!).  I use Cytomax exclusively.  I've tried others - Hammer, Gatorade, Accelerade, etc, but find Cytomax best for me.  It's easy on my stomach and not and provides the needed energy/electrolytes for long rides.  My personal preference is to do 1 1/2 scoops per water bottle rather than the 2 that they reccomend because 2 scoops makes it too sweet for me.  The deal on Amazon is great for the 4.5 lb container too!
314312	I have tried other sardines with the skin and bones on, and I always found them to be completely disgusting! When someone convinced me to try these, I couldn't believe I actually liked them!<br /><br />These sardines are really much closer to tuna than traditional sardines. This makes them taste better -- much less fishy. Plus they are packed with Omega-3, which is a bonus in the health department! Really my only complaint is sometimes they come broken up in the can, which makes them messy to eat.
395004	I have tried many different beef jerky products and Wild Ride Beef Jerky is the best I have ever tried.  It is the most tender beef jerky I have ever had, their is no MSG or Nitrites and the flavor is great I have tried the Hickory, Pepper & Teriyaki -- I will buy Wild Ride again...
42164	Prompt shipping. But at $20 a jar? Are you kidding me? I used to buy multiple jars to reduce overall shipping cost, but they have changed the product listing by raising the price to include the cost of shipping now. Ridiculous. This stuff makes a pretty good pie, but not worth it. I tried the Amish brand to save money, but all it is is colored corn starch. I threw the other jars away. Yuk. Barry Farms is still the better of the 2 product choices on Amazon. If you want a $20 too-sweet, mediocre pie. I wish I didn't love hard-to-get black raspberries so much.
6995	These fill your own K-cups are great to have and use with a custom coffee that doesn't come in the K-cup variety.  They are disposable and you can fill several and have them ready.  I also drink a herbal tea that I buy in bulk and now I can make it with my Kuerig.  Would definitely buy again to have on hand.
24521	We go through a lot of tea because we use four tea bags at a time to make Chai (Betty Crocker Recipe, if you want to try it, yum!). This is the best tea I've found to use. It has a great flavor, I love that it's organic, and it's very affordable. It arrives quickly, too! I highly recommend, and will continue to order regularly.
87358	Definitely unlike other pepper pastes, like GIA and Amore that come in tubes. It's thick like a tomato paste. The flavor is tangy and hints a little Asian flavors, though it is distinctly Italian pepper flavors. I wasn't expecting a specific taste or texture when I bought it so I'm pretty happy with getting something that I haven't experience before. I will find a lot of uses for this.<br /><br />I could see it being an excellent addition to a spicy pasta sauce, or pizza sauce. It may also work well mixed with olive oil and used as a base or spread for breads and pizza and such.<br /><br />Also, it's fairly hot, but not too hot. It's fine for most people who like a little heat, but anyone who likes only very mild spiciness will want to pass on this.
109529	When the grocer ran out of my favorite green tea, I decided to try this variety on the strength of reviews for other Carrington teas on Amazon. The other varieties must be better than this one. Its flavor is bland, partly owing to the fact that each tea bag only contains 1.75 g of tea leaves as opposed to the standard 2 g found in other brands, like Celestial Seasonings. While this is certainly better than having no green tea in the house at all, I won't be rushing out to repurchase any more unless nothing better is available.
457882	This gift made a HUGE impression on my recipient. She liked the giant cookie and remarked how original I was to send her such a unique gift. Delivery was on time and Lady Fortunes customer service was very responsive to my delivery questions. I recommend this for anyone who wants to make a BIG impression!
415204	It is handy to have mushrooms on hand anytime.  The product looks exactly like the picture.  No problem with spoilage.
353793	I never thought I liked mojitos, and maybe I don't, but I really enjoyed the Crystal Light Mocktails Mojito flavor! The color is a bit off-putting, it looks like flat tonic water doused with a serious hand of lime juice, but the taste is very light and refreshing. It's ever so slightly minty with a good lime flavor. I liked this flavor a great deal and will be repurchasing in the future!
130910	If this is as healthy as it is tasty then a great product.  A little pricey for only 15 servings, but that Organic Red Dutch Cocoa is delectable.
234713	"We got the Tug-a-Jug this morning and have used it twice to dispense my dog's breakfast and dinner. She never quite figured out the """"tug"""" method of getting the food out, but she did find ways to get the food out by nosing it around on the floor and grabbing the kibble out with her tongue when it reached the neck of the bottle. However, she gave up this morning with about half her breakfast still in there, which is surprising because she LIVES for food! For dinner  she started crying at the bottle because she got so frustrated with it! I never heard her do that before, so I decided to help her a little. However, when I wasn't watching she chewed all the way through the rope. It's still a usable toy, but I guess she'll never figure out the """"tug"""" method now. It's been about 50 min and she's still working to get all of her dinner out, so I guess I'd say this is a good toy. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars is I think you could use one of your old Nalgene bottles and put dog food in it and it would work the same way. The jug is made of Nalgene I think."
269674	Have loved Community Coffee since I first tried it at the Cafe Dumond in the French Quarter. I was online looking for the original blend with chicory, but couldn't find it available in a small enough batch, since I'm only one person and can't use ten bags of coffee.  I saw this flavor and decided to try it . . . it's delicious . . . rich and flavorful with no acidic undertones . . . even better with vanilla flavored creamer.  I'll buy it again.
22281	I love to challenge my dog with food cubes. The thing is great--most of them are way too easy and dispense the food too quickly. This one is perfect because it is a little bit more challenging, and there are ways to make it harder such as adding pieces into the jug to block the food from being dispensed (like a golf ball). Also, the bottom screws off so it is easy to load in the food. Many food cubes you have to load the food in little by little which is annoying when you are trying to feed your dog his entire meal in a puzzle cube~! I highly recommend this one ( i have 2 other puzzle cubes and this is by far the best).
44570	I'm not even a big fan of dark chocolate but these nuts are delicious! They are the perfect thing to snack on to help rid sweet cravings and they contain the same amount of fat/calories than the plain almonds. They don't even have added sugar!
54782	I love this, have been using and it is great.  I use it for my hair and for my daughter's hair as well.  It makes the hair sooo soft.  I could not ask for better.  Please know that it will be hard to get out if cold.  I usually hold the bottle between my thighs when I brush my daughter's hair then my body heat makes it softer and I can pour it into my hands and into her hair.  I will never use anything else for conditioning.  It is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Have not tried eating yet.  Just cant find it in me to try yet!  But will submit review when I do!
230555	So far, this is my favorite blend of coffee. It has a delicious flavor. Bold but not overpowering. I will definitely be buying this again!
516675	Our 10 month old mixed breed is a very picky eater. After trying a few different brands of dog treats someone suggested we try Zuke's because of the high protein and natural ingredients. Our puppy loves them!  The treats are small enough that I don't have to worry about breaking them up for training. There is a very strong smell with these treats, but it actually helps because our puppy comes running when I open the bag. I will be buying more flavors in the future.
330825	This is a decent balsamic glaze/reducation.<br /><br />It has a faint yeasty taste that I don't care for...not so heavy to preclude using it again, but I have a different brand that I love love love, so this is just a back up.<br /><br />FYI try Blaze balsamic reduction/glaze.  It is superb.
547950	Thank God they had enough foresight to put these in little individual bags.. back in my grad school days, me and my house mate used to get the really large bags of these and take a handful, and then we'd pretend it had no caloric value whatsoever and keep with the handfuls until the whole bag was empty or we'd leave crumbs and pretend that we had just one or two servings.. these are so addicting, they should come with a black box warning. Love the aged cheddar, I have tried the others, they are good but this is just exceptional. Now if you can self discipline to just one bag then you should be safe.. enjoy!
64936	Our whole family loves Quaker Oatmeal.  The Maple Brown Sugar flavor is especially delicious.  Quick and easy to make in the microwave (we use milk instead of water to make it).  Good any time, especially if you're craving something sweet.  Would definitely recommend.
287476	You have to sample them all to find the ones you like.  You'll miss out if you judge them all after tasting one or two.  My favorites are Diet Orange, Diet Raspberry/Cranberry, and Diet Energy. Diet Dr. Pete and Diet Root Beer aren't bad either.  They mix well with alcoholic beverages as well.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />I encourage everyone to visit the SodaStream webstore BEFORE purchasing any of products here. There are many flavors at the SodaStream webstore not offered here like DIET Energy and DIET Orange.  Also, as of 2/15/2012, they charge 40-50% less at the SodaStream webstore but you may have to pay for shipping.  However, if you buy 10 bottles at Sodastream, you'll get 1 bottle free.  I'm not slamming the Amazon merchants but I think consumers should be aware of the significant price mark-up.<br /><br />(With this exception, I've found Amazon prices to be competitive with other stores so I continue to be an Amazon Prime Member.)<br /><br />If you only want one bottle, it may make sense to pay twice as much with free Amazon Prime shipping.
366405	This is an old standby for Fred and he gets 2 as treats in the morning. He usually saves his treats and eats them during the day. If I run out of these, Fred misses them and the other treats stay around longer as if Fred wants to make sure I notice that there is a treat missing. This is a must have for my 10 year old.
75456	This Cocao Powder is the best Superfood product that I have purchased! It is a 150% stronger antioxidant than anything I have found!
93156	This product was everything I wanted in order to make various dishes such as<br /><br />bread pudding or christmas cake or just an ordinary fruit cake.
219704	This is another bad bag of candy. Stale, clumped sugar, too much sugar, tasted flat and old. Even the bag was cheap. Do not buy!!!
559245	Best ice tea ever.  I gave up drinking regular tea because of the caffeine.  I found this tea and have never missed regular tea,  It taste like regular tea with lemon.
536585	Not to be a negative review, but adding some information I learned on this product that I feel should be on the product description for buyers. The information on the package states that the fries should not be given to small dogs. Well, we have a 10# Maltese small dog. Seller was very quick to respond to my question on this, saying that the product is like jerky and should be cut into smaller bits for small dogs. Well, I tried to cut it into smaller pieces, but it is tough stuff. Also, the product is from China. Not a surprise as lots of stuff from China. Other sweet potato fries at local store are from China also. And they say sweet potato jerky on package. I elected to ask Amazon for a refund and they were very prompt to issue a refund. I will go back to my local store and buy the treats I had purchased; the sweet potato fries were soft and moist and no problem for our small dog. These would probably work fine with a larger dog and be no problem for dog to eat.
482966	Great way to top off a meal with controlled amount and not a lot of sugar. One can never get to old for this kind of treat.
59308	Seriously, this is THE BEST Cocoa in the world. I recently made a Fudge Ripple Cake with it, and the frosting (using the Pernigotti Cocoa) was the best I've ever made. Everyone raved about it. Now, the question is, should I share the secret to the fantastic taste of this cake and frosting with them.  Hmm...
171281	I have tried lots of gummy candies and these Tropifruits from Haribo are the very best!
99801	"This is a very smooth coffee.  I do prefer a stronger tasting, darker roast so I will mix these beans with  <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESSASK"""">Cameron's Organic French Roast Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a>."
466593	Only 5mg sodium per serving, chips are crisp.  I sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor.
122850	"I am the director of nurses at a Long Term Care facility and we cook a loaf of this bread in a bread machine everyday.  It's comforting, home-like aroma fills the place as well as stimulates the appetites of the residents;  many of whom don't care if they eat or not.  We slice it up in small pieces and pass it out.  They love it.  Has a wonderful taste and texture. Almost every loaf turns out perfect.  If you like good, wholesome bread, you will love this brand.  The same goes for the Cheese & Herb bread by the same company. Absolutely Great.  A real """"Bread Winner"""".(:o)"
508846	"Outstanding melt in your mouth chocolate.  The dark chocolate is not bitter like many chocolatiers - it has the perfect blend of taste for any chocoholic.  I've had many different types of chocolate from Belgium and can guarantee - Leonidas is the """"Mercedes-Benz"""" of chocolatiers.  The general assortment is an outstanding sampling of ivory, milk and dark chocolate.  If you love dark chocolate then go for the dark chocolate assortment.  You will not regret it.  Also forget Godiva - it's medium grade quality."
339536	We have had so much fun with this product. I actually bought the Candy Crate 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s retro candy boxes for a dinner party in September where we were celebrating 4 birthdays. Between dinner and dessert, I put the boxes on the dinner table and let everyone participate in opening the candies. Everyone laughed and talked for an hour or more about the candy and memories of growing up. Since that time, I have done the same thing with school friends on a recent vacation, my brother's birthday and will be using once again at an upcoming dinner party. The Candy Crate candies are well packaged and you get plenty of product. Be prepared however; the shipping cost is as much as the candy. I have to say that it is worth the cost to see friends and family have such a good time!
97300	This is the best low calorie popcorn I have tasted. It isn't exactly like movie theater popcorn. In my opinion it's better. Movie popcorn always turns out to be too salty and overloaded with unhealthy fat. Skinny Pop is lightly salted and is made with sunflower seed oil, which gives it a nice flavor. If you are looking for the strong movie theater popcorn taste, this is not it. But, this is a light yummy tasting popcorn that will keep you going back for more (I can seriously go through a large bag of these in one day). Can also be found at Whole Foods Market for those that have one in their area.
102742	"These cookies are addictive!<a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L8XKEW"""">Maddy's Sweet Shop Key Lime Shortbread Cookies, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>Sweet, buttery, with crunchy bursts of key lime candies, great on a warm afternoon with tea."
311650	I found out I had a sensitivity to wheat so tried to find alternatives. After getting tired of soft corn tortillas for lunch every day, I decided to try this mix. I put it in my plain old Regal bread machine on the rapid cycle. (Mind you, it's very basic and doesn't have a gluten-free setting.) Wow! I couldn't believe how well it came out. I have made many breads in that machine but none have been better than this one. In fact, I rarely use the machine because the breads don't have the texture I want. This one was different. It was super moist and cut into beautiful even slices. Very good tasting, too, though I'll probably add a dash of stevia to the mix next time (since I like a tinge of sweetness). Even though I'm the one watching my wheat intake, my husband ate up half the loaf he liked it so much. The only drawback is the price, but I guess you can't complain when you get a pack of yeast along with it.
559252	This product is great, I was trying to find a steady supply at a fair price.  But $45.88 for a small bag that costs $3.50 in the supermarket?  I think something may be amiss here.
73354	I hate eggs. I developed this aversion to them because my mother used to make me drink them raw when I was a kid. I felt more punished than healed and nothing in the world can make me eat an egg, no matter how well it is cooked. One problem, though, their protein source is excellent. I need the protein but not the egg. My online search finally bore fruit the other day when I came upon Acai matcha tea. This fine tasting tea has more protein than eggs. Hurray! What a relief...
566770	ok, so I bought this stuff after reading a few review. I found it at cost plus (world market).  Went home and decided to be a big boy and just put it straight on my tongue to really get the flavor of the sauce without it being hindered by any food. I gotta say it really wasn't that spicy. It has an initial tingle on your tongue/heat that starts to creep up but is gone within a min or 2. Has awesome flavor and I'm excited to use it more but I gotta say, my homemade hot sauce is wayyyyy hotter!
487699	If you have a Trader Joes near you - you can buy a 4.5oz bag for $1.69 - Just a Hint - They are awesome candies and good for you too
449252	Our Chinese Cresteds do agility and even though they are very food oriented, it's important to have a variety of special treats to keep them motivated.  For our breed, these are perfect because they are small and soft and the dogs think they're fabulous!  The 4 pack is a good price, too.
149170	We are unable to find this product in very many stores.  We have a number of cats, some senior,regular adult and some younger.  This seems be the best all around food for all the groups.  I helps the more inactive ones control their weight and meets the needs of those that are more active<br /><br />Frank Frasher
540362	Have purchaed through Subscribe and Save through Amazon.com the Pedigree Choice Cuts in Gravy with Chicken Food for Dogs, 13.2 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24) and our dog prefers this flavor over repeatedly and I will always give it 5 Stars!  This flavor has  Chicken in cube bite size with gravy that is just yummy.  Our dog wags his tail the second he sees the can and so enjoys his meal which means the bowl is clean when done! Our pets know when they are being served the best. High recommendation.
172560	"First time I decided to try this out. For Kona the price is great of course, and the freshly opened bag is fragrant, and yet it's one of those """"you get what you pay for"""" situations (except here you get much LESS than you paid for): the brew barely tastes like coffee (even with five teaspoons to a small cup it still tastes like boiled cardboard). You will buy a better coffee in a supermarket; any kind you pick will be better and cost about the same. Bottom line: not recommended (I won't reorder).<br /><br />***<br />05/07/2012: I'm so pissed I paid for this crap, I'm trying to get a refund. The ground matter itself, when dry, smells nice, but the brew... you could brew sawdust with the same exact result. No taste, no aroma, no caffeine kick, no matter how much you use per cup. Black sludgewater. Horrible, and should be against the law to sell it. The only use for this junk I can see is to sprinkle it around the house dry -- 'cause it smells nice while dry. This product is a quintessential ripoff; stay away.<br /><br />05/14/2012: Sent it back and just got a refund. Whew! So that's that. At least I can thank them and Amz for the complete lack of hassle with returns."
514902	I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word. If you like moist and flavorful with a nice sweetness, a whisper of Asian spices and a whimper of heat, then you'll love this Sweet and Spicy Thai Jerky from Jack Links.
70148	"I bought the """"Black Currant Raspberry Black Tea"""" flavor and like it. The primary flavor is the fruit, but you can also taste the black tea under it. I saw some people complaining about not enough tea flavor in the green tea based flavors, but I think the problem is just that green tea naturally has a light flavor. Since this one uses a black tea, it is not a problem.<br />I also tried the """"Blackberry Pomegranate Green Tea."""" I don't mind the flavor, but it is much more like Koolaid, with a very strong sweet pomegranate flavor and little tea flavor."
110989	My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie. They would eventually eat, but it was dragging down their routines. According to the Whole Dog Journal, Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog. The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry. As long as it's a good, quality food, the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry. I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.
160376	Very good for digestive system. Easy to eat with cold milk. Very flaky. Has a nice taste and texture. Sometimes hard to find in stores and the prices are high. You cannot beat the price if you buy from amazon.
339797	i love coconut water.  Vita-Coco, Zico, One, nirvana, amy & brians, goya unsweetned (The ones where they add sugar are gross).  I've even become pretty good at opening fresh ones.  With that being said, fresh is the best but if i had to go pre-packaged, C2O is by far the best.
301473	My dog loves Greenies. They clean her teeth wonderful and is a great snack for her.  I have a very small dog so we cut them in half so they'll last longer.  I was pleased when we found them on Amazon at the price they sell them plus free shipping.  I love Amazon.
512651	Just purchased this product, for half this price at the local Walmart. It melts in hand to a thin oil consistency which is great for moisturizing. It had a light coconut smell, but nothing too overpowering. I came on to Amazon to see if I could get a better price for buying in bulk and was shocked to see the price almost doubled on here for the 12oz container. Do yourself a favor, pay half the price and no shipping and get it local.
81833	Our dog is a hugh White English Bulldog about 3 ft tall and 6 feet long. She loves bacon and loves the flavor of this, but she tries to bite and take the bottle away.<br />The bottle is a roller ball like roll on deodorant, and being a big dog she could choke on this if she did get it in her mouth, which is why we give 4 stars. she loves water out of squeeze bottle and would think this would do better in that type of bottle.<br /><br />I would reccommend this for small to medium dogs, but not for the Mastif breeds.
444059	eden brand is the only canned brand i use because they are the only company that does not include BPA in the can lining and they use steel and not aluminum cans. these beans are yummy, perfect texture and very versatile. use in chili with the can juice or rinse and put in salads or with rice. i puree them with lots of starchy veg to make veggie burgers-amazing!<br />and great price for a whole bunch, much less than at the healthfood store.
527538	"Love this product. I was having such a difficult time """"hiding"""" my dogs medicine in food. Some how they knew it was there. I tried rolling it in peanut butter which worked but was very messy. These pill pockets solved my problem and they love them."
492848	We always drink Timmothy's or Emeril's. Thought we would try something different. Not too many decafs to choose from. We were pleasantly surprised that this had a great taste with a full bodied flavor. I like my coffee on the milder side so I can even get 2 cups from 1 Kcup.
2439	I go for the bold varieties of coffee and this Mahogany is not only bold but very smooth.  My all time favorite!
315945	I first heard about this product on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network and ever since then I have always wanted to try it.  This stuff is great. I use it to season veggies, mashed potatoes almost everything. I love this stuff and will continue to buy it vs regular chicken or beef boullion.
435914	With my favorite brand no longer available, I decided to try the Coffee Bean Direct.  The dark house brew had a pleasing flavor, a hint of sweetness and no bitterness.  All in all, a little better that my usual brand, and at a respectable price. The 80 oz. bad is large and should last at least a month, but being bagged, refrigeration is a must.  A finely ground, dark roast, it even looked appealing when I opened the bag.  So unless you are into grinding your own, this is a solid choice, for a strong, bold cup of coffee.
298628	"After trying all the """"bold"""" labeled K-Cups offered (and even making my own) I think this is the best one out there.  It's bold, balanced, non acidic, has no aftertaste and is well rounded.  Bam !"
456707	My doctor recommended this supplement.  It seems to really help me, so I hope it will also help you as well.  This supplement is worth the money.
155651	i really have to say I love this chamomile tea. Especially when I have a cough and/or cold I brew some and pour it in a bowl to inhale the chamomile vapors. It works just great. Of course I also love to drink it when I'm sick. I like the chamomile taste and that there are not other ingredients in it but the chamomile.
524490	I love Newman's products, but my dog hated it.  We purchased a case hoping to feed our dog something that doesn't contain all of the artificial chemicals, but he wanted nothing to do with it!  If you like organic, support Newman's products.  Hopefully your dog will like it better.
20458	"My ex-girlfriend is a lovely woman in many ways, but her cat...well pretty much everybody and everything is beneath him. He is picky about being petted, how he is being petted, how long he is being petted, and by whom (I think the phase of the moon figures into this somehow too, but I digress). This persnickety nature also applies--in spades--to his food. When I gave Zede (the cat, not the ex-gf) some of this food, he actually ate it without giving me his """"How dare you put this slop in front of me, knave?"""" look. I got reports later that he became even more enamored with the stuff as time went on. So there you have it: an endorsement from Zede the finicky feline. Well, how else do you rate cat food? I'm not going to try it myself...and besides, I'm a vegetarian!"
47024	I have spent the better of my adult life chasing locations for Skinner's Raisin Bran. And the quest has always been worth the journey, when I can find it. Like one other review states...I,too, think that there must be a Skinner's Cult! I could be their leader. My first taste was when my Grandpa bought me a box...and that was around 56 years ago. Hooked instantly! If you are NOT one of their sugar junkies, that our generation created..you will LOVE this cereal!
212201	I love this drink! Tastes just like Yoohoo. Sadly, I saw the price jump and figured I should just buy it at my local Whole Foods...until I realized I can't find it there anymore either!! I don't know if it's being discontinued or what happened but I hope to find it again soon (and not for almost $60 a box).
546669	I give it a try after I read the comment. I'm very disappointed. It doesn't has coffee aroma scent. It just like I'm drinking water. I'll never trust the comment.
85945	These cookies are great. The biscuit part is not too sweet and the inside is a nice vanilla flavor. The designs are super cute as well~
404253	My pups are finicky, but they really enjoy these bones.  I tried several brands before I found these and am so glad they're easily available here.
294220	Sooooo good.  Good thing these are portion controlled to one serving (8oz.) because i could just keep drinking.  Another healthy grab and go for breakfast or late night snack.
197698	Finally a product in a price range that I can say WoW about!If your looking for a product that delivers positive results that isnt 80 to 100$, I swear this is it. I have combo skin and some light scars around mouth/chin area from acne. The results Ive had from using this is diminished scars (not erased scars), clearer skin. It keeps there appearance down. However this product is mild if your just starting masks or have perfect skin already...recommended.
347187	It's okay, but I wouldn't buy it again.  My absolute favorite green tea is made by specialteas.com.  It's a decaf apricot green tea.  I always end up going back to that after trying other teas.  I've even gotten used to drinking it plain without any sweeteners.  A cup sounds pretty good right now!
278582	After disliking their Chocolate Hemp shake, I saw the Manna and decided to give it a chance, hoping that creating that shake was a 1 time bad idea and the company has good products.<br /><br />I should have known better! If a company allows such a bad shake to be in their line, then they just don't have a smart or caring management!!<br /><br />The sandy texture never goes away, and it makes your throat itch, and it's just not yummy! Highly not recommended, if you're already having doubts. Will never buy it again :)
158075	I bought these cookies as Easter gifts for two different family members and both RAVED about the clor, shape and flavor of these organiz cookies. They're sure to please everyone!
63767	"This small (6.8 fl oz) drink has a nice clean coffee taste, with enough sugar to make it sweet, but not annoyingly so.  If you are looking for a substitute for a trip to a coffee shop for iced coffee, this is less expensive (roughly $2 per can currently).<br /><br />However, making iced coffee at home can give better results (assuming good coffee, freshly roasted, and ground just before brewing).  By that comparison, $2 per for 6.8 fl oz seems rather expensive.<br /><br />A few other brief notes:<br /> 1) This is not espresso in a can.  It is an """"Espresso STYLE Coffee Drink"""".  To me, the taste is more reminiscent of a strong cup of coffee with sugar, but not espresso.<br /><br /> 2) It is sweetened with sugar...not corn syrup.  The ingredients list is quite short: coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate.  Not sure what those last two ingredients lend to the taste (they are not preservatives), but I never use them when I make iced coffee at home, and I'm happy with the results.<br /><br /> 3) Finally, since I keep an eye on """"points"""" in my daily diet, I note the following: 50 calories, 12g carbohydrates, 0g protein, 1g fiber.  (I wish Amazon would include the nutrition label for each food product it sells.)<br /><br />All in all, a decent coffee drink that is less expensive than a similar drink from a coffee chain, but more expensive than making iced coffee at home."
461129	I had this at a friend's holiday party, and it was very tasty. I purchased the Mini Popcorn 8-ounce canister for another friend as a stocking stuffer. it was very well received.
50575	"Picture a straight stick, lopped off at the top, with a few bare branches a few tiny bits of green, and you have this """"bonsai"""" plant. Very well packed, but pathetic when unpacked, the only resemblance to the photos on the Amazon page would be the pot, which is identical. We received this as sympathy gift after death in family. Hard to imagine a more absurd item. Noted this to the sender, who apparently complained and got a second sent, very similar to the first. Deceptive photo, this item needs a strong disclaimer against use as a gift."
61403	A friend requested loose Jasmine tea for her birthday and there weren't many options. Being in a hurry, I bought it, keeping one of the 3 packs for myself. I think the price is rather high, but the package zip locks, and the favor is nice. Strong enough to know it's jasmine, but not annoying.
414132	These crisps are high in protein, calcium and flavor. They are pretty low in carb count so people with sugar issues can enjoy them instead of standard potato chips.
46581	If you love Peanut Butter but don't like the calories, THIS IS YOUR DREAM COME TRUE!!! This peanut butter tastes, looks, and smells just like normal peanut butter! But the calorie content is so low that it makes you want to eat lots more of it! Definitely recommended! Works great for baking products too!!!
398784	"They are delicious, yes, but I'm confused how a relatively small bar packing this much fat can be called """"healthy.""""  And they sure don't tell you about it in their description!"
382869	"I got a SodaStream for my birthday.  It comes with a 12 pack syrup sampler with 6 diet syrups and 6 """"regular"""" syrups.  I have only tried the diet, caffeine-free syrups.  None of them come close to tasting anything as good as the diet drinks I buy at the grocery store.  Even the store brands taste better than the SodaStream diet drinks.  They remind me of the pre-Nutrasweet sodas that used saccharine as the sweetener.  I use my Soda Stream to make seltzer and it does a great job at that!  I've been experimenting with using drink mixes like Crystal Light, and those work OK.  DISCLAIMER:  I'm one of the folks who get a bad aftertaste with Splenda and Splenda is the sweetener used in the diet SodaStream drink syrups."
121007	with an old timey licorice flavor. just a few satisfies that sweet craving without doing too much damage to your calorie counting!
112745	The ingredients that are listed for this food are incorrect on this webpage.  This is a premium food without corn gluten meal.  Check out the Premium Edge Website to see the real ingredient list for this food.  This is a great low calorie, high protein food.  New research has found the benefits to feeding an overweight cat a low carb, high protein diet to prevent diabetes and other cat diseases.  Most diet foods are higher carb and low protein which do not help a cat loose weight efficiently.  My cats love this food.
199510	Disappointment with this shipment. Firstly they came loose in the package, then there were only 22 flakes ( I counted several times) and they tasted somewhat stale. ( We are cadbury flake regulars!), even though the sell by date was not reached. They must be for the Arab world as they had the Arabic writing on  the items. I had used this same seller I thought in the past and got a proper yellow box with the correct number inside. Anyway not the end of the world. I will try to be sure of the supplier next time I order flakes.  I should have sent them back but could not be bothered.
89527	Millet flour is great for my gluten free recipes (just remember the xanthan gum). This company takes a little while for shipping and the shipping is a little high, but, the products they sell are cheaper than anywhere else with a greater variety offered.
541499	Normally I would have rated this product high as a high-protein bar with a good flavor.  However, the manufacturer has loaded the bar with artificial flavor and artificial colors (yellow 5&6, red 3, blue 1).  Therefore I do not recommend it as a diet or health product.
259816	I bought these as part of a diet I was following, and found them to be delicious!  Since you get a whole case, I gave a box to several members of my family and they also thought they were great.  Some break during shipping but overall, they were not especially damaged.  On a diet or off, these are very tasty!
376296	My Grandson has problems with constipation and this product works great. We give him some every other day and he has no problems! Quick shipping.
300181	I have been on a crusade to lower my sodium intake and when I found this product I was pleased. I don't use Ketchup on anything but do use it in several recipes so the no salt was a real factor.<br /><br />I have never liked ketchup on anything, even fries, but I do like this product. It has a great tangyness and full flavor without any salt!!!<br /><br />I used it for a meatloaf recipe I have and it came out really good.<br /><br />One small drawback is that it seems to have a relitively short shelf life so I just keep the extra bottles in the fridge.<br /><br />This is a fantastic product.  More food product companies need to take this route.  We need healthier food and at the same time it tastes better when done right.  Kudos to Hinze for a great product.
41642	When I opened the much-anticipated package, it smelled dusty and stale, which should have been my first clue. When I looked closer, I found it was at least half twigs & sticks, and the other half a poor quality crispy dry 'white' tea with moldy-smelling lavender buds.  Tried using it for tub tea...smelled musty there too! From now on I will stick to mixing my own - best I've found is Davidson's silver needle with Harney super blue.
291806	LOVE the flavor of dark magic... Of all the many flavors of KCups this one stands out to me and all the others pale in comparison. Great price And also cool flavor name
655	Good quality nectar.  Very tasty.<br /><br />However, I was expecting 46 fluid ounces, not 46 ounces in weight.<br /><br />I find that 46 ounces in weight makes about 32 fluid ounces.
282550	"Earl Grey has been one of my favorite teas since the first time I tried it (roughly 2 years ago).  I like the taste of bergamot, though I can understand how some might find it strange or overpowering.  This product was, to me and contrary to the opinion of others, just right in terms of strength.  I always use the lowest water setting on my brewer and am able to clearly taste the tea with no trouble and without feeling as though it should be diluted.  Of course, I should clarify that I drink my tea like my coffee (that is black with no sugar).  As a result, the tea may be too dilute when mixed with milk, but I can't say I've tried it that way.  I also haven't found it to leave """"tea dust"""" behind, like another reviewer claimed, but that could be due to luck on my part or bad luck on that person's.  If you're looking for a delicious earl grey tea for your Keurig brewer, look no further."
331950	These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  They start off sweet, then as you eat more the spice builds up.  They are fantastic.  If you don't want to commit to a whole case, pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first, then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are.  Got my case right here, and loving every bite.  On a side note, this brand (Kettle Brand) has many delicious varieties- this is just my personal favorite.  I also highly recommend: Backyard BBQ, Honey Dijon, Sweet Onion, Buffalo Bleu, Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle.  Lays aint got nothin on Kettle Brand!!!
515715	Beautiful popcorn when popped and when sitting on the shelf waiting. It popped both white and yellow making the bowl just look more appealing. The hulls did just explode! It was amazing, I've never had popcorn do that before. Great deal, I'm glad we bought the 6 pack. Worked out to about $2/lb. I think some people who gave a bad review must have gotten a bad batch because ours is awesome!
461883	I bought this to frost my husband's birthday cake.  He is not diabetic but likes to be very careful about eating sugar.<br /><br />Although the flavor and sweetness were fine with this frosting, I would not recommend it.  For some reason, it was far stickier and sort of gummier than a regular canned frosting.  I think if we *needed* sugar-free products, I'd be ok with it, but I won't buy it again for our family.
126047	We just love these mixes. They are all delicious.  My family loves cupcakes and these make great ones, 24 at at time. It is all I use now. I order them so as not to run out. The flavor and texture is like homemade. The frosting, which I am reviewing,  is fabulous.  I cannot stand the canned frosting...yuk. Do everyone a flavor favor and use real butter only for the frosting. (moderation)  It makes all the difference in the world. If the cake is not sweet enough for you just add a little sugar but for us it is just fine and  with the sweet frosting it is not a sugar overkill. I love it is all organic and tastes this good!  Easy to make too. The sprinkles that come with this are a nice taste/texture addition too and they also are all natural. Try the chocolate cake with vanilla frosting and yellow cake with chocolate frosting...yum!
222123	The Kool Aid folks got smart. I didn't know that they had changed their packaging to small and easy to handle tubes.<br /><br />I had switched over to another brand because the Kool Aid took up to much time and handling........<br /><br />NO MORE !!  The packages are now nice flexible tubes. Great for not only making quick and easy at home---but also for traveling. getting together with friends...all you need is water and a container.<br /><br />I have always loved Kool Aid as a soft drink  and now I have even more reasons to enjoy it. Quick , easy and reasonable cost.
383014	"""""Only my hair dresser knows for sure,""""  Well I don't know about that, but the folks at Amazon know how much cat food I order (on account), both dry & wet foods.  Before I even offered Newman's Own Organic Chicken & Brown Rice formula to my five cats, I could see the difference.  Upon openind the first can, I was so pleased to see real chicken broth (organic of course). It was clear broth just like boiling chicken on stove top. It was really fresh looking too., So then the real test when offering to the three indoor cats.  All three approved.  I given only small portions at one time, yet my kitties cleaned the bowl, eating right up!  Never, ever do I recall when my kitties have been so accepting of their wet food. I've owned and cared for cats for over 25 years, and this food really impresses me! I now order it via """"Subscribe & Save"""" (Amazon program) and it will be delivered at regular intervals.  The first case was damaged in shipment (3 or 4 cans were damaged so bad that the contents were running and dripping from the carton. I contacted Amazon and they were gracious as usual and are sending a new case for my accomodation. The only concern I have at this time is that this particular formula is """"out of stock"""" and currently not available from Amazon, though it can be purchased from WAG.com.  I also make purchases from WAG.com and though their prices are slightly higher (most of the time), they are also a great company and have a good variety of foods for both Cats & Dogs, as well as other pet items.<br /><br />If you've never read Newman's Own QA report and product description, be sure to do so. I think you'll be impressed. I was."
299643	TOTALLY AGREE with the two previous reviewers. Have frozen about half of the content, and put the rest in 3 of 4oz jars and kept the two in the regular compartment of the refrigerator and one outside in room temperature. This BRAND works very well with my bread-making effort.  Fantastically MORE economical than buying in small packets in supermarkets. On the strength of the first reviewer I took a chance and appreciate her taking time to review -- so I'm doing the same.<br />Seller, please DO NOT RAISE PRICES ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR GOOD REVIEWS -- BRISK SELLING SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH REWARD. BOUGHT 2 POUNDS FOR $14.88 --JUST TO PUT THE SELLER ON NOTICE. HAVE OBSERVED IN THE PAST THAT AS SOON AS I BOUGHT ITEMS FOR MYSELF AS WELL AS FOR MY RELATIVES, SOON AFTER, THE PRICES HAVE RISEN CONSIDERABLY -- THIS HAS MADE ME WARY OF REVIEWING PRODUCTS WITH CONSIDERABLE ENTHUSIASM.
351031	This is the big daddy bear of the Gummi Bears. This Bear has come on the scene to take revenge on all those that have been yumming down too many Gummi Bears.<br /><br />The Revenge takes place on several fronts so be warned!!!!<br /><br />[1] Extra sticky portions are designed to stick between your teeth to give cavities and to try to rotten them out completely.<br /><br />[2] If large bits are taken, the portion will attempt to make you choke.<br /><br />If you are successful in getting this Daddy bear down into your tummy, the revenge continues on a new level:<br /><br />[3] It will make you heavier, 4.5 pounds to be precise.<br /><br />[4] It will make you fatter, 12,500 calories to be precise.<br /><br />[5] It will increase your blood sugar and attempt induce a stroke or diabetes.<br /><br />If you are successfull in digesting the Daddy bear, he has one last trick:<br /><br />[6] Hint: take a very thick book the next time you go the washroom.
548156	I had hoped that this oil would help with my dry ends.  When it arrived, there were no directions whatsoever on the bottle, which was made of fairly flimsy plastic.  I was unable to find directions in Amazon's product description either.  So before even opening the package, it's not very consumer-friendly.  Reading other reviews, I was able to glean that a little goes a long way, so I used about 3 drops put in the palm of one hand, rubbed my hands together, and then ran my hands over my hair concentrating on the ends.  (I should note here that I have fairly fine, smooth long hair).  Almost instantly, my hair was weighed down and greasy as though it hadn't been washed in a week.  With 3 drops!  Fortunately it did wash out with the first try, and it had a very nice, shea-butter scent, but that's the only positive.  I'll be tossing this and would certainly not recommend it.
326764	My wife tried ordering this item thru a Amazon listed seller (caiman) December the 10th it was due to ship out in 3 days (for a x-mas present nonetheless), by end of January it had not shipped. I cancelled our order with caiman and tried to order thru AMAZON itself the same day Feb 3rd i believe. Here it is March the 20th. No nothing , just an endless extending wait. Apparently AMAZON & their sellers feel they can list items they dont , wont and cant stock. Dont waste your time. I just cancelled my order and bought it on E-BAY , it will ship tommorow. Forget Amazon, or unless you like being blown off endlessly by email with no LIVE person to talk to, then by all means order this thru Amazon (or Caiman!). I prefer to spend my money else-where, this has really soured me.
478829	"Our medium-fussy, senior dog will not eat beef (unless it's off our plates) but our puppy (who is HUGE) seems to enjoy these two flavors, and is never reluctant to eat when we give them to him. We've only started feeding the dogs Mighty Dog within the past six months, and are satisfied with the product, since there are plenty of choices and we have found three varieties that our senior will eat.<br /><br />Our vet always asks what we're feeding the dogs, and when I reported """"Mighty Dog and Little Champions,"""" he didn't give the standard lecture about sub-standard dog food. We did, however, get the standard lecture about tooth-brushing..."
29809	"""""Plantation Mint"""" recreates old traditional Southern USA fine, mellow, balanced black tea with cool spearmint to invigorate, refresh and soothe at any time. Good icy or hot. Good with or without cream or honey. With natural spearmint leaf added to good black tea leaf. With richly balanced tea and mint in individual sealed steeping bags. Healthful antioxidants from both the black tea and spearmint. Soothes even someones belly as well as attitude due to MELLOW spearmint known to do so -- such as versus ache, nausea, heartburn and indigestion. Not somewhat harsh like peppermint yet not somewhat bland like green tea. BALANCED indeed. Great virtue at a small price for this pack of six 20-count boxes. Bigelow and Amazon, thank you ever so kindly +++"
41329	Checking prices out on the website-this is ridiculous. I can buy a gallon of this at Wal-Mart for $2.50-$3.00. I don't know where they're coming up with $39.99 for 4. I called Amazon and they were not any help. Just beware.
277238	So my cafe at work switch to a bunch of chips I don't like and some Popchips.  Then they added these sweet potato chips and they're the only ones I buy now.  The sad thing is that these are hard to find at stores.  You'll find plenty of the other Popchip flavors, but not the sweet potato.  So I broke down and bought a box.  I went with the 3-ounce version because the price per oz was lower than the smaller bags.  These bags aren't TOO big, and I just use a clip on them to keep the air out after they're opened.
84695	I bought 10 lbs of belly flops a while back and those were so good and very sweet.  These jelly beans or not as sweet nor tasty. There seems to be a lot more root beer beans than any other ones.  They did not come in bags just a box of jelly beans.  The value was very good for the money, but in the future I'm only going to stick to flops.
363131	Sumatra coffee is one of the best coffees I have drunk.  Use an extra fine grind (expresso)for a strong, bold flavor experience.
559925	The apple cinnamon one is my favorite!  But I do recommend both.  They are wonderful, nutty, high fiber, protein - don't taste like microwave oatmeal at all!  Throw in fresh blueberries and you have a great breakfast!!
428943	I just opened my box and these things are yummy! Great pineapple flavor, and it has a nice chew.  Although I prefer chewier bears like Haribo, these are still gummy enough for my likes.  I guess I can understand what people say by them being a bit yellow compared to the picture.  But that pic is probably taken with some bright lighting.  They look exactly the way they should be. Any other brand of gummy bears, when you get to the white/pineapple one..it looks just like this.  Will def order again...but not sure what other flavor I want to try
420640	I use the Kind bars to keep me going at work when there's no time to have a meal. They are crunchy and good tasting, they also seem to sustain me during the day. Great product!!!!!!!!!!
381147	"It used to be, when I was young, that you could go into a local candy store and sit at the counter and get a malted milk shake.  Today, there seems to be no candy stores, just ice cream palaces who make a """"milk shake"""" , which, really, is just glorified chocolate milk.  With the absence of malt powder from the supermarket shelves, I thought that that taste was gone from my mouth forever.  But no!!!  Here it is, available at a good price, waiting to be delivered to, and used by you to bring back the taste and texture of malted milk shakes!  and for those who have never tasted a malted milk shake, well, what are you waiting for?"
503385	I've been buying these for years and was delighted to find them on Amazon.  Super value here.
398536	We were going through this stuff like crazy, so this bulk packaged box was a great deal for the price.
15745	So far I've had no problems ordering this product and receiving it as promised. I am a Nantucket lover and occasionally will buy a specialty/seasonal flavor on the side.Green Mountain is extremely expensive at most local stores! I've been buying bulk online for years. (I'm a coffee-holic) I suggest buying/trying a sample at your local store. (some even will let you brew a free cup!) Then, you can decide where your taste takes you! Happy sipping!
524334	"I used 3/4 of a cup of boiled water per packet, and it turned out great! You can add thinly sliced sauteed beef and a small pinch of dried chili flakes to this soup to change it up, but it's perfect just the way it is.<br /><br />If you can visualize yourself taking a long deep breath of ocean air, the briney parfume filling your nasal cavity is the best way to describe your overall taste experience. Plus, it has just the right amount of soft, thin seaweed pieces.<br /><br />My four year old son loves it, he'll ask for two servings when I make it.<br /><br />""""Kikkoman Instant Wakame Soup Is A Winner!"""""
356408	I bought this to help me sleep because of the tons of great reviews. I couldn't get down more than a sip. I didn't expect it to be great, but it was down right unbearable. It's impossible for me to take. Huge waste of money,
369345	This flavor tastes very good. Great product!!! I subscribed to receive one box every 6 months, very convenient and great service.
507504	"Fond memories of kid hood as I readily consume these childhood snacks.  So glad to have found them! They are moist, as so well packaged in 14oz bags. A bargain.

319409	...and he hates everything. I fed my cat Iam's for years, because his vet reccomended it and therefore I figured it must be the best for him, but after the cat food scare, I wanted to get out of all the traditional brands. The vet reccomended another brand, which I cannot think of the name right now... that you can buy at PetSmart. It was pretty pricey - about $28 for a 64 oz bag. My cat hated it, he refused to eat it, and it looked wooden.But I took him to a playdate at a friends and he has this habit of eating out everyone's bowl and came across Newman's Own in his friend's food bowl. He loved it! My friend sent me home with enough to transition him and I ordered a bag instantly from Amazon. And if you are looking to go organic with your kitty, comparatively, the price for Newman's Own is right. Much cheaper than those in the same class.
117950	I love PB and eat way too much of it.  I have tried Walden Farms salad dressings and liked them, so thought it was worth giving thier peanut spread a try.  What a mistake, I couldn't wait to get it out of my mouth.  I brought it to work for my co-workers to try, since they also like this brands salad dressing, but they all had the same reaction that I did.  There isn't enought jelly in the world to make this edible.
268989	I had heard so much about this drink.  I really wanted to like it.  I was imagining it would be like the coconut waters I had tried from Thailand and the Philippines.<br /><br />It's like drinking cold vomit, there is no other way to describe it.  Really gross stuff, stay far far away.
120270	This is my second time ordering this product. I first take it in the morning as a substitute for coffee. You can feel the boost of energy by the second swallow. The taste is a bit sweet for me.However, it has all the nutrients that can carry me throughout the day.The price is also very reasonable.<br /> I recommend this product without reservation.
488076	I love this coffee and it's getting hard to find in the stores now. Best tasting coffee around. Rich and frothy!'
403056	This cherry-chocolate nutrition bar is a perfect example of a snack that tastes bad for you, but is really good for you. The ingredients include whole wheat flour, rolled oats, walnuts, and canola oil. At 200 calories each, one or two bars makes a great quick breakfast-at-your-desk or afternoon pick-me-up.
354860	The non-diet flavors all have Splenda.  In addition to sweeteners.  Tastes awful.  If I wanted artificial sweeteners I would've bought the diet sodastream.  Ick.
243291	I love Click! I don't know what I'd do without it. I drink one every morning on my way to work, using a Blender Bottle. It has as much caffeine as two coffee drinks with 15 grams of protein. It tastes like iced coffee straight from the coffee shop. I love this stuff!
48763	I'm not sure I like pepperoni in the bites size.  My dogs love them!!! They sure smell better than the pupperoni dog treats!!  I think I prefer slices of pepperoni.
346497	BIG HIT!  My little granddog loved them.  I would buy these again, had never seen them in the circle shape.
22844	Last night i fried some of those pre-packaged Simply Potatoes in a little vegetable oil and the duck fat, and they were amazing.  You wont believe what a wonderful, rich flavor this give to ordinary foods!
49926	Personally I love these food bars. Most people do not. If you like the taste of carob then these bars are for you. If you don't buyer beware.<br /><br />Great for anyone on the raw food diet.
500830	Tasty coffee.  Works well in drip coffee maker.  Smooth taste and nice flavor.  Remember it's preground, so don't expect fresh ground, recently roasted bean taste.  But it's a lot more convenient.
114777	None of us in the house really liked these.  I was hoping for a grab and go breakfast for those many days we are late for school, these didn't work.  We have yet to try them after heating, but heating takes time...
334941	I did not drink more then the first 2 oz because I could not get past the texture, there is way too much of a chalky texture to this tea.
51865	"I've been buying this coffee from a local store chain for about 5 years and it is one great coffee! It is always satisfying, has a nice finish..which is that """"aftertaste"""" you get. The coffee folks like to call it finish.. What's really nice is that the price is always lower than the other organic brands. I've served the decaf to friends and they raved about it afterwards. A great value for an outstanding product."
491178	Got this gum in Germany and Kuwait and wished the US would sell it in our stores, but I will continue to purchase online if I have to, to get it.
557720	"This is my 3rd Coopers malt concentrate used and it produced good results. I did not use dextrose, but instead purchased Weiss unhopped malt extract and use that instead. I also added 3 cups of turbinado sugar to bost the ABV and an additional 1 oz. of Saaz hop pellets. As is the case with any of these kits the 1 week for bottle carbonation/conditioning is the bare minimum. I let mine bottle condition for 3 weeks before chilling and drinking with very good results. It produced a good refreshing """"pilsner like"""" brew. A little cloudier than true pilsner, but great feel and flavor. True pilsner has to be fermented at pretty cool temperatures, and we don't see those very often in Tampa, so this is as close as I can get in a home brew. It was very refreshing, and with the summer heat and pool parties 6 gallons was gone in a flash.<br /><br />I have had good results with all the Coopers malts so far, and this is a great one for your friends who are used to macro brews. It has very good taste, but isn't so hoppy or malt heavy that it will give them pause."
36453	Miracle Noodle was easy to prepare. Took the flavor of the foods mixed with it. It was not as filling as I thought it would be. Delivery was within days. Would buy this product again. This was a Amazon Verified Purchase.
329168	I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably won't purchase this again.
237758	Worked great the first time, but not the second time I used it.<br />Brookstone customer service was easy to work with and is sending<br />me a replacement unit. Hopefully it will work like the 'first time'<br />for many years to come.
262558	Great candy bar!  Very light and guiltless.  I had a few of these once that someone brought from a vacation and kept one of the wrappers so that I could find them here in the US and I did here on Amazon however, I do feel they are overpriced.  A 10-pack for $40 that equates to $4 each plus tax/shipping which is too much for a candybar let's be honest.  I can't bring myself to order at this price but had to tell you that they are just wonderful.
262300	My cat really likes this expensive brand of food, so I spoil him. The other 3 cats I live with eat a much less expensive brand and you can totally see the difference. While my cat does weigh a bit more than the other cats, his fur is so soft and he has absolutely NO digestion or hairball problems. He also gets an A+ from the vet every time we visit. It's nice to spend the extra money for a perfectly healthy cat.<br /><br />While it is worth it, this food is definitely on the pricey side. On top of that, the price recently went up another five dollars at my local pet store. I've been ordering it off Amazon ever since then! I save over $5.00 on the bag itself and free super saver shipping really makes it great, since it saves me from having to make a trip to the store, and one 15 lb. bag usually lasts me about 2 and 1/2 months. So this is the absolute best deal. Really happy with this.
326675	If you are a Columbian coffee drinker and need a little less caffeine at times, this is the best!  I like it almost as much as my regular coffee.
341502	I thought these would be a good substitute for regular salt and vinegar chips but they are not. However, Pop Chips are a great alternative to regular or reduced fat chips.
67975	These are alright, but I really don't like candy peanut butter (even though I do like the stuff you get in a brand-name jar).  I've also never heard of making smores with peanut butter, but for some reason these have a bunch of little M&M-sized peanut butter candy things inside.  Also, the marshmallow-like extrusions are pretty hard to crunch up.  Overall, I liked this reasonably well (the graham chunks are good, as are the cocoa almonds and honey-roasted peanuts - and even the hard marshmallows), but the peanut butter really turns me off.  If you, however, enjoy the way the peanut butter-like filling in a generic Reeces peanut butter cup tastes, and you think you would like that taste on smores, you may also like this. :)
489792	"I really, really love Tender White Popcorn!  I was so dissapointed when the packaging changed and you received less popcorn for the same price AND it was in a """"bowl"""" that had plastic on the top and bottom.  No only does the popcorn burn, but you also get possible issues with the heated plastic.  Now it appears that Orville Redenbacher is changing the name to """"white popcorn"""" and leaving off the tender; as if this is a """"new"""" product.  I have switched to organic popcorn.  It's not as tender, but I know that it is not genetically modified either."
301618	I love this chocolate no wonder the BRITS' want to keep it for themselves. I'm so HAPPY! to find it on AMAZON, I used to only find it once a year at Christmas now it's Christmas all year long!!!! Thank's for importing it AMAZON!
98073	Wow, I have tried it all and this is about as close as it comes to the best coffee houses in Los Angeles. I'm so glad I found this product!
180656	This tea is so tasty!  I use 2 bags and make a 10 oz hot tea.  After it steeps, I pour it over ice and enjoy my favorite drink of iced tea.  This chocolate hazelnut is great.  It takes care of that chocolate urge in the afternoon.  I love it!
451430	I LOVE these!!! I grew up on them but everyone I have try them end up loving them too- including my boyfriend who lives by meat. It is often a turn off when people see they come packed in cans. Ignore that part because they are fantastic and very high in protein. I did catch my boyfriend trying to boil them- not recommended! You can microwave them (about 1 min), fry them on non-stick, put on BBQ, or my favorite way- over a camp fire! Yummy :)
497108	Mango Peach isn't the worst of the beverage enhancing MiO products, but it certainly isn't the best. Alone the taste is a little much, the good thing about Mango Peach however is that it is more versatile than the other flavors. You could drink Mango Peach just mixed with plain water. Or you could add it to teas, lemonades, or mixed drinks. Some complain that MiO isn't cost effective but that would only be the case if you use a heavy dose with each mixing. I'd say with a standard squeeze you can get about 20 drinks out of MiO, it all really depends on the amount of flavor you desire. The small, easy to carry packaging makes MiO far more convenient than a bunch of little Crystal Light packs. As a product overall I give MiO five stars, as Mango Peach I can only give it about three.
543513	"I'm not so sure about Vitamin Squeeze. It works a lot like Mio, just squeeze a bit into a glass or bottle of water and drink. We do need to refrigerate it after opening, which makes it less portable, and the bottle is pretty big. Mio is at least small and can be carried in a purse.<br /><br />The """"energy"""" comes from a variety of vitamins and minerals and caffeine. The labeling says it's not for children, but I let my children try it. Let's just say they didn't care for it. Personally, I like the taste of Mio better. Vitamin Squeeze is a little too sweet without much flavor. I was underwhelmed."
38979	Personal tastes vary, but this is one of my favorite ready-to-drink shakes. Lean Body shakes have the consistency of milk, are mixed well, and have only a minimal aftertaste. If you are a fan of really thick shakes, this probably won't appeal to you. If you are looking for a shake that provides a nice level of protein and vitamins for the price, this is a good choice. If you are looking for a post-workout shake, this is easily digested 15-25 minutes after a hard workout.
311491	"I say surpisingly because the ingredients were sort of unusual - Cinnamon was one of the main flavors and 1 of my dogs is picky.  All three of them took off with them as if they were special treats, and I had wanted to try them because one of my dogs is on a diet, and this was a low-fat treat.  Unfortunately, there were only 7 in the package, so it's doubtful I'll be buying them again.  I prefer the <a href=""""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AYL9NU"""">Get Naked Low Calorie Dental Chew Sticks for Dogs, Small/6.2-Ounce, 18 sticks/Pack</a>, because although they are smaller in size, they lasted about as long as this treat, and they weren't all gone after the 2nd one.  Still, The ZOE Low Calorie Chew Sticks would be great for a household that had fewer dogs."
267806	I gave this flavor to my 6 month old son but he did not like it so I tried to blend it, but still no luck. It does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends. So I mixed the blended beef stew with green beans ( 1,5 oz of beef stew with 3,5oz green beans ) and my baby ate it all no problem. I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it.
135716	Great for on the go, I work in a job that I don't always got to eat lunch on time so grabbing a bar is a great way to eat. These are great, the only thing is that it comes in a 5 pack because 2 bars are in each pack. But it is still a great deal
553005	This is a must have for vegetarians for the pantry.  Handy uses galore as a substitute for ground beef.  Comes out of the can in great condition.  I love this on tortillas and in chili.
428234	As a fan of hot sauce on everything, EVERYTHING, I have to say I think I've found my equivalent of crack.  Sprinkle a little (crack/NW Elixirs Hott Sauce #1) on breakfast, lunch, and dinner, or you'll start craving it.  It adds great depth and kick to stews and hashes, I've added it in to a peach BBQ sauce I used to glaze baby back ribs and add a little kick, with eggs or eggs benedict it gives just the right amount of burn.  The mass market hot sauces lack the depth and rounded flavor found in this hot sauce.  Tabasco just seems too thin in both texture and flavor and while siracha is great, it still doesn't have what this sauce has.  I'm having a hard time describing exactly what, specifically, is in this that no other hot sauce has because it's difficult to articulate, but once you try it, you'll figure it out and never look back!
508808	I buy these crystals instead of the teavana german crystals.  I like the color variations equally well and the flavor even better.  From the ingredient list you can see they kinda cheat the process but the end result is fabulous and the cost is less so who cares.  Note, they have improved the shipping process a bit by adding a plastic bag around the box.  You don't lose any sugar anymore but some of the sugar leaks from the box making use of the box to store the sugar a bit impractical.
380189	This is one of the few times that Amazon has really let me down.  According to the company that sold this item -- Nutricity is the name of the company -- Amazon mispublished the price of the item.  I was supposed to get 60 of the Numi pots for the price they advertised, but I only got 10, because according to the company that these pots came from, Amazon made a mistake.  No one called me to correct the mistake, but it was corrected on Amazon when I back on-line to see what had happened.  I kept a copy of the advertised price that I bought the pots for.  I am terribly disappointed that I was not contacted by Amazon and told of the mistake.  So, instead of 60 pots for $265+, I got stuck with 10 pots.  I called the manufacturer and asked to return the pots with them paying the postage for the mistake.  The rep at Nutricity said she'd get back to me.  I never heard from here again.
472268	These little gummies are very tasty (as you can tell by the title) I bought them right before I left for college and they were gone from my room within a couple of days. I've been looking for them ever since and just now found them. I will definitly be ordering some!
254752	No bitterness, the warm smooth taste of soothing delight.<br />What a treat to sit down relax at the end of the day<br />or with a friend & mouth watering backed goods.
84831	Excellent!  This is not the first time purchased.  Love to add it to many types of foods/dishes.  Many of our friends also like it; in fact, we buy extra bottles so that we can pass them out to our friends!
89795	I always read the ingredient labels on my food to avoid product preservatives like sodium benzoate.  Any food for my dog needs to meet the same standards.  Costco's Kirkland branded dog foods have met my budget needs as well as provided quality nourishment.  Was Chef Michael's quality enough for me to shell out twice the price?  No.  But then again, I'm cheap and I know it.<br /><br />I personally dont have a problem with grains and soy.  I grew up on the same ingredients in mom's cooking.  And if it's good enough foe me, it's good enough for my dog.  As long as my dogs likes the taste and receives the essential nutrients he needs, mission accomplished.
103232	a single pump in my coffee is heaven. we've been trying all the other sugar-free flavors, but vanilla is always #1. it's awesome to mix in with plain yogurt too! bf even mixes it in his milk with cereal. can't go wrong with this stuff! oh and the pump is a must have.
444673	Bought it for the wife who is on a diet.  She likes it and keeps her on the diet.  How can I loose?
411212	My dogs love this food. While it is being re-hydrated they anxiously wait for their meal, they can't wait till it's time to eat.
258915	Having moved to the USA a couple of years ago I missed my Branston Pickle and cheese sandwiches. Amazon has come to the rescue and I've bought the 6 pack. If you like Branston Pickle then you'll find this is a must have!
406441	"Does it make me smarter? Nope. Does it taste fantastic ice cold? Yup. I love this water. Why does it taste so much better than other waters? It tastes the way I imagine the polar ice caps taste, the ones that have never seen one atom of pollution,<br />germs, dirt or anything else, just pure hydrogen (two molecules) and oxygen (one molecule).<br />That's what this tastes like. Crisp. And it doesn't hurt, even though it's silly, to imagine as I drink it that I'm getting smarter from that added potassium and magnesium, two minerals we all need more of, especially our brains.<br />I'm sure my brain, being mostly water, appreciates this. Yes it's a brain drink, psychologically at least.<br /><br />Smart Water is purified tap water although the website does say that some plants may use spring water.<br />Every single mineral and chemical that can be in water is removed. Things like arsenic and chromium are not detected in<br />Smart Water once it has gone through it's treatment and filtering process. The website for this states that it<br />is """"pure as the first drop of rain"""". Then the minerals potassium, magnesium and calcium are added to it.<br />These minerals are important to good health and a long life. The website has a long list of solid particulates<br />that can be found in most water, and throughout the list, after the purification process of Smart Water, none<br />with the exception of a tiny amount of flouride can be detected.<br /><br />This intense purification process is what is responsible for the pure clean taste of this water. I was hoping to find out the pH since it is better for health reasons to drink more alkaline water but that was not to be found.<br /><br />I enjoy keeping Smart Water on hand as one of my go to brands of bottled water, along with Fiji and San Pellagrino, the winner as far as mineral content and alkalinity. I avoid drinking tap water as much as possible due to the chlorine it contains, which is a known health risk. This has a remarkably fresh pure taste and the health benefits that a mineral water can provide.  Comment | Permalink"
32680	This tastes great!  I use it as much as I can as a sweetener for tea, cereals etc..  Plus you are supporting organic farms and natural foods.
206287	"Our family used these bags for a while... it's great to find a non-gmo cornstarch bag that is REALLY biodegradeable, unlike some of the poop bags, which say they are, but really they just break down into a billion tiny scraps of plastic (so they theorize they """"degrade"""" faster than regular plastic. However, this just means more tiny micro-bits of plastic in the landfills and ocean!). Beware what you read in the product descriptions! It should be 100% """"compostable"""".<br /><br />However, seems these bags just keep getting more expensive. Good product, but I want to pay as little as possible to throw out poop! I recently discovered another similar product at about half the cost, which are called Nature Babycare Eco Diaper Disposal bags: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001EWDPPU/ref=rcxsubs_mys2_product_title<br /><br />Obviously, these are intended for disposable diapers, but work just as well for poop. They are a little thin (a little thinner than the Bio Bags), but they work just fine and I haven't had any problems with them. They are about the same size as the Bio Bags with tie handles. They are white, not black like the Bio Bags, but don't show through, so they are a winner for us. I'm really not too picky about what to throw out poop in as long as it works, it biodegrades, and I don't end up with poop on my hands. I'm happy to find another product that costs less, hope this helps someone else."
341990	Delicious Coffee. Good value at the 6 pack. Win - Win. It is organic too.
464746	Bring this coffee back into stock! Please! Very disappointed that you no longer are choosing to carry this great coffee! You can't do this to an addict :)
472610	I received this as part of the Amazon Vine Program.<br /><br />I now many review says is not strong coffee but for me<br />it is just perfect. It is not overpowering and a great flavor.<br />I would says more like tea than coffee.<br /><br />I think is great coffee and I love the little packs.<br /><br />Perfect for the office.<br /><br />Highly recommend it.
488263	Senseo Dark Roast pods provide a strong, vibrant flavor that seems to me to be similar to the Starbucks regular brand,  I limit myself to two cups per day and really prefer this more robust variety of coffee. I am not disappointed by the brew and find it saisfying. Using Amazon's Subscribe and Save Plan helps my budget and is completely convenient.
395261	Cranberries are sweet and delicious!  Very fresh!  Tightly packaged!  Very quick delivery!  Second time buying from this vendor, will definitely be back!  Great price, too!
53917	I had this at a resort in another country, and was told it was very popular in Europe. Now I know why, this stuff is really good. If you love chocolate and hazelnuts, then you'll love this.
143415	"Can you believe we have a dog who is even picky about her treats....?  Well, she can be --- and we've given many a package away to NON-picky pups we know.  The Zuke's obviously hit the spot with her, and the price is certainly right!  She gives this product :  """"Five Paws!"""""
315431	I was very happy with the speed of the delivery and the quality of the treats.  My dogs love them.
346743	We found this in a small town/small store this summer and have been unable to find it anywhere since.<br />The manufacturer's website says it is sold at Schnucks, Shop N Save and Dierbergs but none of them carry the product so I ordered it online and wrapped it up for Christmas!<br />My family was both surprised and thrilled!  Everyone received 1-2 boxes under the tree. Too bad no stores in the St. Louis area carry this product - - we love the marshmallow flavor.<br />Merry Christmas! and I will be ordering again from Amazon!
380037	It certainly has a unique texture, I love how squishy they are. I thought the dough would be firmer like bread dough but it's more gummy and soft. The taste is delicious, I prefer strawberry over melon. I haven't tried traditional anko yet but I definitely will and can't wait.
346593	i got these in about 4-5 days after payment.<br /><br />i gave them one each when i got them. and put the rest away for Christmas...<br /><br />well my dogs didn't stupid they go up the the closet and sniff every time i open it lol<br /><br />so i assume they loved them
186299	"I eat well.  I read a lot of research on health.  I'm a Medline junkie.  I've tried a lot of different supplements in my time--- probably 40 or 50 different things over the years--vitamins, minerals, herbs.  Some of them made me kind of ill, some had a minor positive effect. (For example, I noticed that ginkgo actually did help me think more clearly, at least a little bit.)<br /><br />None of them, however, made a MAJOR positive impact on my life.<br /><br />That is, until Natural Calm.<br /><br />This miraculous substance has improved the quality of my life dramatically!<br /><br />Here are the things this supplement has helped with:<br /><br />Sleep--- Basically cured my occasional insomnia, and gives me a deep restful sleep every night.<br />Stress-- I now feel spectacularly relaxed.  Also increased my ability to deal with difficult """"crisis"""" situations.<br />Mood--- Made me generally happier.<br />Decreased muscle cramping and soreness.<br />Improved gums and teeth.<br />Improved hair loss.<br />Improved digestion and transit time.<br /><br />Yeah, hard to believe it cured so many things, right??  Me too!<br /><br />But out of all the things I have ever taken, this is the ONE THING that I would NEVER be without.  It has made that important an improvement in my life.  It is almost like a miracle.  Really.<br /><br />There is a huge amount of research on the need in the body for more magnesium than Americans usually consume.  Especially important is the ratio of Calcium to Magnesium you consume.  In America this ratio is about 4 to 1.  Ideally it should be around 1 to 1 or 1.5 to 1.  I have settled on a ratio of about 1200 mg Ca and 800 mg Mg per day.  (Try """"The Magnesium Factor"""" by Margaret Seelig or """"The Magnesium Miracle"""" by Carolyn Dean here on Amazon if you want more science of magnesium.)<br /><br />I highly recommend that everyone try this supplement, at least for a week or two.  You probably won't need that long.  I noticed an improvement in two days.  A MAJOR and IMMEDIATE improvement.<br /><br />If you try it, I'd be curious as to your results.  Leave a message in the comments section of my post, if you want.<br /><br />Here's wishing you great health!"
234132	"This was my initial review:<br /><br />""""This spice dressing mix was tasty, when used with oils to make a nice sald dressing.  It works as a marinade, and a rub.  Very versatile, reliable and flavorful, but not WHAM!, not """"I have to have more of it for lunch today"""".  Just pretty good, alongside many other pretty good options for the summer salad season.""""<br /><br />Now, many montbs later, having used this on steaks, sea food, bread with olive oil, many mnay products, I want to say that I was too stinting in my praise.  This is excellent, a wonderful spice mix, something we have used, relied on, and enjoyed in many ways.  This has become a must-have for our pantry."
377141	I found this at our local TJ Maxx - there was this bar and a box of others that were individually wrapped for gift-giving.  I bought this bar to try it and see if I liked it.  I read the wrapper's description about marzipan and pistachio - and I was intrigued.  I have tried marzipan once before and wasn't all that impressed, but this combination is SPECTACULAR!! I was only going to have one, but one piece turned into two, two turned into three and I had to stop myself there before I devoured the entire package.  I wish they made this with dark chocolate, but the milk chocolate will suffice.  Will purchase again if given the chance - but these won't last long at TJ Maxx!
273483	This green tea has great flavor. Some green teas are bland and end up tasting like nothing but green water. This tea is not that way.
146801	I ordered a 5-pound bag of assorted taffy (Taffy Town brand) through my Amazon.com Prime account because my kids really wanted some, and my daughter had recently gone on a trip to a taffy-making factory.  She liked it a lot, so we found this product, though it wasn't the same brand she'd had on her trip. However, she said it was just as good; I've tried some also and agree with her opinion.  BTW, 5 lbs. is a lot of candy!
423594	"These are over priced, seriously? $29.19 for a 24 pack? They cost 99 cents at stores like Wal*Mart. So lets do the math, (24*.99= $23.76) SO ($29.19-$23.76= $5.43). THAT IS $5.43 OVERPRICED! PLUS $24.49 for shipping? WHAT?! I have ordered larger and heavier items on Amazon and shipping is no where near """"$24.49""""!<br />NOT BUYING FROM THIS SELLER!"
371248	I have a daughter with Autistic Spectrum Disorder... DAN! (Defeat Autism Now!) had an article that implied some connection between gluten and dairy allergies to behavioral difficulties in children with this disorder. So, we decided to try a gluten-free, dairy-free diet to see what happened. I have to say I have seen a good deal of improvement in her general behavior as well as her focus and retention rate.<br /><br />From what I understand it is a good product for kidney patients as well because it is low protein. And it's Kosher Parve.<br /><br />I tried these pretzles because of this new diet and now my whole family is addicted! They are tasty, crunchy and not too salty, but still satisfy my desire for salty foods. We will be buying these from now on.
371694	This is such good stuff, and it's quite healthy. It contains plenty of trace nutrients as well which are vital to our everyday functions, such as eukronium and phosphoric acid. My kids love it! This brand should serve as an example to the rest of this industry.
121092	My chihuahua puppy did so well on this food, but then I could not find it anymore. I tried a new food, but she had diarrhea and bloody mucous. Finally I put her on the Avoderm Small Breed Adult food as the formulation is a lot like the small breed puppy version, except with a little less protein. My puppy is 8 months old now so I figured it was okay. Now she is thriving again -- nicely formed stool, very silky coat that is luxurious to touch, and lots and lots of cheerful energy. I am not kidding. I hate paying a premium price and having to go way out of my way to buy Avoderm, but my dog does so well on it that I am going to keep her on it. How much can a 3 pound dog eat, anyway.
137260	I've been a subscribe & save customer for almost two years with this coffee and I can't say enough good things about it. I sometimes try other brands of organic coffee but this is a standout. Convenient 2 lb. bags and monthly shipments suit me perfectly. Cafe Altura Biodynamic French Roast is the best coffee if you like bold flavor and missing all the insecticide sprays  you get on regular coffee beans.<br /><br />I recommend burr grinding only what you are brewing and storing the coffee in an airtight container at room temperature.
528766	Everytime I order these, my family, friends and coworkers would just eat them up in record time.  Everyone seems to LOVE these gummies; they're almost addictive.  You really can't go wrong here ;-)
16795	"It is a good concept to carbonate juice.  The kids loved it and called it """"soda"""".  It has a nice flavor but it is difficult to taste the individual fruit juices though."
50755	"I like Fig Newtons and have been missing them since I cut out white flour and enriched flour from my diet. These are made with whole grain and taste very good. The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list """"high fructose corn syrup"""" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does. This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it."
331000	This product is absolutely worth purchasing if you are a gluten challenged person. Of course it's not a wheat pizza crust, but even still it's very good. It's got a nice chewy texture and making it is a snap ( I only use 1 egg). I can actually get three 12 inch shells out of the package very easily. I divide the dough into three balls and don't let it rise. I freeze two of them for later use which seems to work just fine. When I spread the dough into a shell on a baking pan, I then let it rise in the oven for a bit at low temp. Then I precook the shell so it is just starting to brown on the edges. Put the toppings on and finish cooking. For us gluten challenged folks, this is the real deal.
35436	This tea is very tasty. I love it at night with a little soy milk and splenda!!would recommend this for people trying to up their healthy green tea cunsumption.
491140	"By that I don't mean it was grown by free range hens, or plucked from the lush fertile soil of virgin Canadian tundra.  What I mean is that you had better chew slowly lest you find your dental work impinging upon bits of sand and grit directly from Canada.<br /><br />My tub tasted somewhat more fully than the """"Nutiva Organic Shelled Hempseed"""" 5 lb. bag.  But the Nutiva lacked the sand and grits.  All told it's a toss up between the two.  I'll probably go with Nutiva next time, despite the higher price, as so not to put my teeth and dental work in jeopardy."
47152	Superior flavor, not too green, not too black. Loved it from the first cup.I put a hint of Splenda/Sugar blend in mine and am substituting it for coffee these days. Stumbled on it in  a shop but will be getting it thru Amazon in the future. I am here now because after tasting it I wanted to be sure I could buy it on line and have it delivered to the door. Again, a definite yes product! maggiemay
169989	A good way to start shopping for this product is to call Enfamil to see their current pricing, keeping in mind any differences in can size and number of cans in a case. I have purchased this product through Enfamil, Amazon and a few other places, always taking advantage of the best deals.  I have purchased Gentlease in every conceivable size and also case and continue to use it for my twins.  When they reach a year, we plan to go to quit.<br /><br />Next... The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months of age. But here in the U.S. after your 3 months maternity leave, are you able to pump enough and store in a refrigerator at work? And you might need formula anyway as we do. I mention this because some imply their formula is as good as human breast milk.<br /><br />We're blessed with twins. They started out colicky and we found that Nutramigen worked at that time. They got through that phase and we've been using Gentlease and solids. After they're a year old it will be all solids. Our pediatrician recommended Gentlease. It has 1/5 the lactose of milk-based formula.<br /><br />I really researched formulas. There are even organizations promoting the sale of human breast milk and there are organizations wanting to stop the sale of human breast milk for fear of health hazards that the FDA cannot control. No matter, those offering breast milk do so at prohibitively high prices - nothing charitable about it.<br /><br />All the brands that I've seen have DHA and ARA, nutrients found in breast milk that promote brain and eye development, iron which is necessary for growth and many more ingredients. The government requires them to have certain ingredients. The major brands do not seem highly differentiated to me except for their specialy models. Gentlease is one of those.<br /><br />Gentlease is one of the special formulas because it has a much lower amount of lactose as well as broken down proteins to make it easier to digest.<br /><br />The prices vary and so do the size of the cans and the number of cans in a case. Unfortunately, I haven't seen Gentlease in big cans at the big box stores. One can also check at the local pharmacy or grocery store for comparison purposes. Keep an eye out for coupons too. You've got to keep constant watch for the best price, and there have been times when the Amazon price prevails.
218033	We use this on just about everything. Eggs, hamburgers, macaroni salad you name it! Livens up anything you add it to. Just wish it had come in larger size.
358207	I got pregant again when my son was 6 months and my breastmilk stopped coming in when he was 7 months. I started him on this formula and we have had no gas problems, no constipation issues, and he has only been sick twice (and for only a few days each time). He just turned one and is challenging us with a switch to organic whole milk...so, I am here to order more. I could not ask for a better organic formula and I feel I am providing him with the best nutrition possible in this formula if he cannot breastfeed. We tried a couple other brands of regular and organic formula early on and I was suprised that he did not like them. We tried to use them because they were free, but I ended up giving them to my sisters who do not use organic and their babies are sick a lot and one is constipated all the time.
189279	I really love this seasoning. First found it at Sam's Club by Tone's. Can only find it at Amazon.com now. It's similar to Mrs. Dash but I like this better. Sprinkle it on my salad everyday before I put on my salad dressing. Really like that there's no salt in it.
195192	My son loves to eat these in his lunch. He also uses them to dip with his applesauce. These are great healty snacks. Better order 2 cartons because you will eat them quickly!
380746	Admittedly this was my first purchase of beef jerky.  I felt the size of the package to be on the skimpy side.  1  1/4 or 1 1/2  oz would have been more satisfying.  The beef quality was not consistent.  Some pieces were in crumbs; others were almost large enough (and tough enough) that I was worried about loosening a tooth crown.
332440	Disappointed big time.  The flavor lasts a very short time and if you leave the pack in the car (out of the sun and still wrapped) you will be very disappointed with the outcome.  Gum crumbles.  Main compliant though is the flavor lasts only a short time.
131423	Picked this tea up at Heathrow. Loved its smooth, fragrant, flavor. Couldn't wait to buy more, was so glad Amazon had it.<br /><br />The fragrance of the tea is wonderful, like a lush garden after a rain shower.<br />The taste is just as wonderful and smooth. Just make sure to follow the steeping recommendations on the box, as it does become quite strong and slightly bitter if left to steep more than 4 minutes.<br /><br />This tea is especially tasty with cream and sweetener--if that's your preferance.
64586	I had read the reviews on this rice and I was skeptical.  However, when your cooking it, it actually does make you kitchen smell wonderful.  And with that you will have to try it yourself to actually smell it.  Once you taste the rice, it is wonderful.  Normal rice needs something with it to add flavor.  This rice is so full of flavor that it's hard to describe.  I know I will buy this rice over and over.  It tastes Great and it's actually good for you!
102428	I originally discovered this product at Whole Foods when looking for a healthy fiber-rich carb source to add to my daily breakfast, and think the taste of this is absolutely great.  If you are used to a high sugar baked bean product (eg, Heinz Baked Beans), this will surely be less sweet, however.  My girlfriend, who also eats healthy, seems to only taste one ingredient in this - the Sorghum, and doesn't like it at all.<br /><br />I'd suggest trying it once (if you can buy it in a local supermarket, buy just one), and if you like it, buy it in bulk from amazon as the price is much better here.
447654	This India spice chai tea wasn't my favorite purchase. In fact, I am thinking I would relist the unused teas in the container and get rid of it. Hopefully someone out there loves it. It's almost a new box.
180216	People differ greatly when using this product. It has indeed changed flavor drastically for many people, and left others feeling less than enthused. I did notice changes (lemons tasted like candy and I could eat Strawberries, which I can never do because I find them too tart), but it wasn't overwhelming and most things still tasted exactly the same. My friend and I tried first with one, followed 5 minutes by a second. 2 hours later we did three at once and drank. The alcohol still taste the same, which was surprising given the number we had consumed. All in all, a fun product to definitely try but don't get your hopes up - you could be one of those people who is not affected by it at all.
297755	Oookaaay, it's official: I am ADDICTED to Judy's sugar-free caramels! When I first tried Judy's caramels, I tried the triple treats which made my palate sing in high praises! Then I purchased another batch of the triple treats along with the chocolate caramels. I must say that this batch tasted a little too sweet, but still deserving of 5 stars, IMO. To counter the over-sweetness, I ate them together with a few walnuts (whole, in the shell--fresher tasting) and sometimes almonds....DEEEELICIOUS!
221927	I got these at my local Publix. They're the best tasting almonds of the bunch. The butter toffee tastes natural and the almonds are of good quality. They also make dark chocolate covered almonds. They taste like Cocoa Puffs but are still pretty good if you're looking for a cocoa kick instead.
272042	After spending three years in Germany, we became fans of the fancifully-shaped marzipan that was a staple for major holidays.  It's not easy to find these wonderful morsels in the average U.S. shops, and when you do see them, the flavor is not that special.  This assortment is just as we remembered, and family members are delighted to find several pieces in their Christmas stockings.  It wouldn't be Christmas without them!
310307	... I was excited to find these on Amazon, but i was a bit disappointed.  Unlike the bars I have purchased locally, the bar cannot be extracted from the wrapper intact; they stick to the wrapper as if they had not been kept in a cool dry place.  Except for the annoyance of peeling them off by pieces from the wrapper, they are still quite tasty.
271118	My colleague had bought these at the health store and I took a bite just now and basically DIED. I can't believe this is kale! it doesnt' even taste like kale. So yummy! I just ordered 5 packs from Amazon!
296801	I breast fed for 6 months and at bedtime I would be worn out and wouldn't feel like pumping and my husband would want to feed. This was great! Now we use powder and make sure to grab these for whenever we are on the go. I love not having to measure out powder and finding safe water source. We travel 3k miles to visit family and this made it a breeze!
182762	I was on a business trip with my husband and we took our poodles along.  I needed treats for the poodles and saw these - figured I had nothing to lose.  WOW, my dogs loved them!  Usually they will hide their treat and try to steal the treat for the other dog, but with these they never left their own.  Amazing - I must buy more!
258739	These protein drinks are sooo good!  I went with the variety pack to try all the 4 flavors and my favorite was the Vanilla (it is delicious) followed by the Chai, which at first I did not like but by the time I finished the box I changed my mind.  The chocolate I did not really like, but I tend to never like chocolate drinks so don't listen to me on that.  My favorite thing about it was that they are big (15.9 ounces of yum) as opposed to other protein drinks that are what, like 10-12 ounces or so? I am not sure but anyway these are big, delicious and definitely fill you up for a few hours.  I used them as meal replacements.  They got a little too expensive for me to use everyday so I alternate between this and another brand.  Oh one thing I wanted to say- usually meal replacement drinks/protein drinks give me an upset stomach specially the first few days.  These drinks never gave me a problem, so that is a huge plus.
404508	I remember buying these at a local store as a kid for a penny apiece. Now a theater box is around a buck and has 16 fish in it. Inflation sucks but I still grab a box once in a while for a little pick me up.
190492	These are delicious! You can really taste the strawberry and they make a great snack or part of my breakfast. They aren't the biggest bars though so I don't find them to be super filling. As far as pricing, if you can get these on sale at your grocery store, then it's pretty similar but you can't beat having it delivered to your front door.
197018	Well, it's filling, and fairly low-calorie at 140 for the bar. I had high hopes for this bar, given the promise of fruit and nuts, which is reinforced by the packaging that prominently features pictures of raisins, almonds, peanuts and cranberries. Opening the package is the first of the disappointments. The primary ingredient is oats, followed closely by corn syrup. Tiny specks of cranberry, raisin and almond, with a few peanut chunks. The flavor is very sweet with a bitter aftertaste. This is not a product I would recommend or choose to purchase.
192686	"Don't take offense, I fed this brand for years. But, a look at the ingredients shows that it is garbage. No wonder our pets are suffering so many diseases that could be prevented with proper nutrition. Corn, wheat how this crap is legally sold as dog food or even touted as """"wholesome"""" is beyond me.<br /><br />Want a starter book on the horrors of the pet food industry? """"Food Pets Die For"""", check it out<br /><br />we switched to a more natural kibble several years ago but even then the years of feeding junk food did its damage. Our Dane was diangosed with lymphoma, and since has been switched to raw pet food such as Nature's Variety and Primal. If you love your pet, at least check them out. They are pricey, but for a healthier/longer life, well worth it."
479760	We've owned several wine bottle resealers, but this is by far the best design.  This is our second Vacu Vin, and both are working like new.  The other brands we tried just didn't seal well.  This is also the only company that designed a clicking sound in the pump to let you know you've gotten all the air out of the bottle.  We keep the wine resealed for weeks and I can not tell the difference in the taste of the red wines kept at room temperature.  I have not tried to reseal a bottle of white wine that should be kept chilled so I don't know if this would seal as well so I couldn't comment on the results.  But, for my red wines this has been great.  I've been very disappointed in other more popular wine sealing products on the market.  The others I've tried have lost their vacum effect over time, and there was no way to know if you got all the air out of the bottle.
429661	We have try other kinds but they cant  beat Wabash Vally Farms real theater popcorn popping oil .. theres no other like it ..yummy yummy ..
277034	MY DOG LOVES THESE. HAD NO PROBLEM DIGESTING THEM AND THEY ARE GOOD FOR THEM.
338616	I drink my coffee as coffee, nothing added.  In my opinion, Caribou Blend is the very best K-cup coffee out there.  The blend is perfect and the taste is smooth, not too bitter.  Also, about the caffeine - You get your morning wake up with no jitters.  My number one K-cup.
263869	I love these mints, especially the Wint-O-Green flavor. I always keep them around the house and often enjoy a mint after a meal; it seems like the perfect way to wrap up a nice meal. They're also great for mid-afternoon snacks when one has a case of the hungries and wants to minimize the calories.<br /><br />The nutrition facts on the package give the serving size as four mints although I usually eat one at a time after a meal. Four pieces have 60 calories so one would only have 15 calories, not bad for a snack substitute. As is usual with many candies there is no fat and no sodium. Also of interest to me was the fact they're made in Canada, not China.<br /><br />My wife and our guests seem to like them too and I'm always pleased when guests help themselves to a mint when they're over for a visit. We keep a bowl of them out on the kitchen counter.<br /><br />I've noticed that not all stores carry the Wint-O-Green flavor and some stores that do seem to be out when I drop by to re-stock; they must be popular because the Wint-O-Green display will be empty and the Pep-O-Mint display will be full. I suppose I can understand that because they do taste better to me too.<br /><br />I like the idea of the large bag since that requires fewer trips to the store, and I particularly like the idea that I can order them now from Amazon on my computer and save the gas money. The price also is better than the sale price at most stores.
113047	Smiles... Thank you Lord, for I have found another healthy snack food that is unsalted, and tastes great. I almost gave up on finding a potato chip like this. The only thing i would ask Kettle to change is the texture. It's slightly hard/crunchy, but not a problem at all. I would just prefer it to be softer. Kettle if you do make that happen, please keep everything else the same. Thank you.
130764	When I received the Manhattan Chocolates I was really unhappy with it from the beginning. The box of chocolates had pieces of chocolate that were loose under the plastic wrapping of the box...which had me thinking this wasn't gonna be good. So, as I opened the box it became more and more apparent this really wasn't a good product....you know when chocolate is old it turns light brown or whitish??? Well, that's how ALL of the jelly rings looked. This box was nasty and I would never order from them again...very disappointed
181154	This coffee is something all should rave about at the price compared to other you must pay more for a commerical resaurants.
354239	The coffee has a great flavor for decaf. I am disapointed in my most recent shipments. One in four of the k-cups explodes in the machine when prepared. The top comes undone and grounds and hot water go every where. We brew other offer coffee in our machine without any issues. I called the company and they are aware of the complaint and have had others. I really wish this didn't happen because the coffee is so good. This is the second time purchasing this product where this happened. It is so difficult to find a really good decaf so I am really disapointed. I do have to say that Amazon's customer service in resolving this issue was excellent. They imediately got back to me, offered a refund and are looking into this issue. Hopefully this issue will be taken care of for future purchases.
139526	I've been using this off and on for the past 6 months.  I mix it with almond milk and some wheatgrass powder (from Amazing Grass).  Sometimes I'll add a scoop of chocolate protein powder.  I'm not sure about the energy because I drink coffee in the a.m. too, but what I've noticed is I haven't been sick this winter at all.  Every year I get sick a couple of times, so I attribute it to the Amazing Grass.  My kids won't drink green drinks but they do like this (minus the additional wheatgrass).
509028	I've been feeding this along with 2 other Natural Balance canned flavors to my 3 cats for about 6 months now and they absolutely love this stuff. I feed the two girls each a half a can in the morning and another in the evening, my 15lb boy I feed 3/4 can twice a day. I also leave them a bowl of Blue Buffalo kibble out to snack on, which honestly they eat very little of and I am thinking of removing it from their diet. They can't wait to dig into the Natural Balance and once the bowl is down they inhale every last bit in less than 5 minutes. Their coats are super soft and shiny and their eyes are bright and shiny as well and they have crazy amounts of energy, annoyingly so at times as they sound like they're going to tear the house down with all the running, jumping and wrestling they do...even my 12 year old calico has developed much more energy and has been participating in the mayhem.
552002	Fast shipment. Great product which I had a hard time trying to purchase locally at my supermarkets and stores. Great tasting soup.
57750	My husband's favorite candy are Haribo gummi bears. I purchased 2 bags and they were very fresh. My husband will be eating these for the next year. Great buy especially for the price.
343123	This is delicious but it's easy to overdo it.  A little powerful when too much is applied.  Great way to avoid salt though.
183258	So I bought it to try it, I'm on my 3rd day and I am loving it. It curbs my appetite, I eat a lot and I snack a lot, after drinking this I haven't snacked, there's a bag of gummie bears sitting on my table, and I haven't touched it yet. I will be ordering another set and we'll see if my fat starts shedding. I drink it after lunch, after eating. You're suppose to drink it with food in the stomach, it works until the next day! I love it!!
248123	I travel a lot to places that lack healthy eating options. This is a wonderful companion to take with me. Apricots are also amazing.
474412	Blue Sky Free Cola is the best tasting diet cola I have had.<br />It's sweet and no after taste. :)
244736	I love this bar and eat it every day, it's very healthy and  tastes great but it's priced twice as much what I paid at local supermarket.
364080	I really enjoyed this chocolate, which has a very strong chocolate flavor without any overbearing aftertaste.  The sugar is just right and the texture is perfect, with no sign of waxy residue.  It would be perfect for cookies, but also ideal for eating on its own.
515649	These stuffed mushrooms arrived with no cooking directions attached.  (I purchase frozen food online from another retailer---everything comes with cooking directions, times, etc...I am used to superior products.)  I perused the original site online for the proper cooking directions, then followed them to the letter.  First, I tasted one mushroom right from the oven, then I waited until they cooled before the next attempt.  Then, I waited one hour and tasted the product again.  There was absolutely no taste.  I couldn't discern a crab taste or aroma; nor could I sense the taste of mushrooms.  I  felt like I had a mouthful of tasteless bread crumbs.  I'm not willing to ingest a boatload of calories while experiencing no taste, so I threw the entire tray of 9 mushrooms into the garbage.
309343	"My little poodle is soooooooo pickey...she never eats treats.<br />I purchased these hoping she'd eat it. I bought.........<br />14oz Free Range Apple Chicken Breast Wraps, also banana wrap & liver wrap.<br />She LOVES all 3 of them...WOW what a surprise. The treats are not hard so it's easy for the princess to chew. lol  I give it to her whole...normally anything I give her has to be cut up in tiny pieces.<br /><br />Okay, now here is my big concern. I just realized they are """"Made In China"""".<br />I don't like this. With all the tainted products out there, the majority come from China. Take a LQQK at FDA recalls...veterinary. I am not saying that this product is bad, it may not be & than it may be bad for dogs.<br />I have to research it further, as we all should do before letting our pets eat treats & food.  I hope this is okay for my dog since it is the only treat that she'll eat."
237871	I looked forward to this tea and I don't know why.  I was disappointed in the flavor and I have made better tea myself by adding a drop of Anise candy flavoring to green tea.
278169	Glad to be able to buy cases of vegetables and have it delivered right to my door. Good green beans.
118990	"This is the same with most imitation vegan products they wont taste like you want them to, they will always be a little """"off"""" I guess you could say. These aren't """"bouncy"""" like the normal ones. They aren't terrible but they take time getting used to."
297720	This dressing was very edible, nice bacon flavor, thicker than some others, would buy it again
19847	We have this model about a year now.  It hasn't worked right from the beginning.  We often had trouble closing the top.  Sometimes it doesn't work at all.  Other times it works like a charm.  When it works like a charm, it's not uncommon to find coffee grounds in the cup. It's a mess.  I bought the same model for the office. The experience was similar.  Sometimes it makes a full cup of coffee other times it doesn't.  Sometimes it won't even work at all.  We have to turn it on and off and cross our fingers. A friend reports these problems as well.  I agree with the reviewer who says, DO NOT BUY.  A waste of money for the machine,for the K-cup that couldn't be used, and an exercise in frustration. We're in the market for a different brand.  When Keurig first came out, they had the market.  They have a lot of competition now . . . which hopefully will make it easier to find a machine that works well.
464194	I've personally seen Mr. Trivedi turn poor quality champagne and wine into great tasting stuff, and I've experienced the uplifting effects of his energy transmissions, so I have every reason to believe in the powers of the Trivedi water. Because I am receiving energy transmissions from Mr. Trivedi, plus drinking the water and taking Trivedi probiotics, it's hard to determine which of the amazing effects are due to the water, the energy transmissions, or the probiotics, but I can tell this story about the water: I accidentally scalded a large spider in my bathtub. I really hate doing that, because I like spiders. I fished him out of the water, but he looked limp and dead. I watched him for a really long time and was sad that he never moved. I put a very small amount of the Trivedi water on him and left, and when I came back, he was gone. He obviously got up and walked away.
360638	"Rooibos is Afrikaans for """"red bush."""" Grown in South Africa's Cederburg Mountains and harvested during the summer, this tea acquires its unique red color as a result of fermentation (in mounds) and oxidization, when it is spread out to dry in the sunlight; naturally it is green.<br /><br />Rooibos is known for its health benefits stemming from its rich content in vitamins, antioxidants, flavanoids and minerals (inter alia, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, zinc, potassium, fluoride, manganese and alpha-hydroxy) and has a long tradition of medicinal use among the local Native population; among other things, it is known to help cure asthma, hay fever and other allergies, acne, eczema, colics, indigestion, insomnia, and nervous tension. Containing very few tannins and no caffeine, rooibos has a distinctive aroma and amber color.<br /><br />This tea blends well with various spices and condiments; my favorite mixture is a delicious loose leaf blend sold by my local tea store, which features orange peel, cinnamon, grated coconut, finely minced chili and red pepper. For a more commercial alternative, though, Tazo's Red Bush tea is a great choice as well: a rich, exquisite blend of rooibos, hibiscus, orange peel, rosemary, several lemon ingredients (lemon myrtle, verbena and balm), as well as a number of sweet spices. Enjoy!"
191920	Well, I was sad when all of my kids thought these were nasty.  They LOVE the Clif Z-Bars, so I thought these would be kid friendly also. Not so much.<br />I have the big variety box, and we've tried all of the flavors...none of them was a hit.
324707	I was excited to order these as the price is $2 less per package than what they sell for at Whole Foods.  To my dismay I ordered 5 bags and I received the 'unsweetened' product.  The difference between sweetened and unsweetened is drastic.  No one in my home wants to eat them.  There is a no return policy on this product so I just spent $25 for five bags of un-edible product.
367054	The second half of the first bar I ate was better than the first half, so maybe this is indeed an acquired taste.  It's unusual, and doesn't taste much like either chocolate or raspberry.  And yet... somehow I felt satisfied once I got to the end.  So with any luck, I'll enjoy my remaining 11 bars!!
393072	This coffee is awesome.  Kinda bold, with a sweetness.  Excellent my son says with International's Carmel Macchiado creamer you can find in the dairy section.
408802	"I have mixed feelings about this product.  The pita chips are tasty, being flavorful and lightly salted; however, they are very hard.  I feel like I'm consuming slate when eating these.  Most of the chips are comprised of the two sides of the pita """"pocket"""" layered together solidly.  A few of the chips are just one-half of that (one side of the pocket), and those are not too hard.  If you like bagel chips, you might like these.  I would say these are even harder than bagel chips, but they are similar.<br /><br />The other problem I have with this product is that there are many broken chips in the bag.  It appeared that at least one-half of the chips had shattered into tiny pieces.  These pieces are too small to do anything with, except maybe throw them on top of a casserole.  But that's not what you are paying for in this product.  I might have just gotten some badly mangled ones; but because these are so brittle, I can see that they would shatter easily.  So I just wanted to warn others that you might only get about one-half value out of the bag, in terms of chips being a reasonable size.  Even the usable chips vary a lot in size and shape.<br /><br />These do taste good, and I'm disappointed that otherwise I find them unpalatable, because these would be great for hummus.  But if you like a very hard, brittle sort of snappy chip, you might enjoy them."
481929	Why don't they just rename them Triscuit salty garlic onion flavor?  The cheeses are all subordinate flavors. Just awful! I'd have read the ingredients if they hadn't been in microscopic font.
483702	So to the ultimate licorice test. I gave my son one of these sticks and a Red Vine. The Red Vine was longer, so he grabbed it first. It was redder two. After he gobbled it down, he gobbled down Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice Twist.<br /><br />I went and sat down and waited. There was a pack of each of these on the kitchen counter, by the sink. He asked could he have more licorice and I said yes. He went for Newmen's own. Nuff said.
378766	The presence of few bitter hazelnuts eclipses the good nutty flavor of the majority. Wish there was a way to 'sniff' out the bitter and rancid ones. Will not buy again.
170430	Very tasty made mince pies with the product my friend really enjoyed making them with me they were delicious tasted great!
173402	This was one of the best k-cups decaf's ever! I look forward to having my morning coffee- it is bold but not bitter. Tons of flavor! I will be reordering this!
490960	love this tea....appreciated the sellers quick shipping. Worth the price. I tried so many different teas available here in USA.Didn't like most of them So, being from canada I knew I would have to go back to my favorite Tetley orange pekoe which is made in england for Canada. Glad I did. Good seller too.
52705	If you like pure, unsweetened green tea this is the best out there. Absolutely love this stuff and recommend it to anyone. It gives me great suttle energy and I believe it even enhances my cognitive thinking.
296636	Delicious individual bars. Arrives in perfect condition all the way from the West coast. It is chewy and chocolaty and gives you the double pleasure of a perfect combination.<br />Bon appetit!
335557	I enjoy a cup of hazelnut coffee on occasion, so this is a nice coffee to enjoy - GOOD taste!  It is at the top end of the price I will pay per each, but almost all K-Cups have been outrageous in their price increases lately.
438126	Thought I'd order these as they were my wife's favorites while growing up on the East Coast.  We were a bit disappointed.  Delivery was a bit slower than expected and the flavor of the Krimpets was reformulated. Guess we won't be reordering.
331963	Not too salty like regular supermarket chips, this is a snack that will not overwhelm you with guilt! When you just gotta have some chips, Kettle Chips Lightly Salted chips are the what you've been searching for.<br /><br />There's no cholesterol, no trans fats, no artificial anything -- and because of the manufacturing process, they actually seem to have kind of a home-made quality.<br /><br />This is an excellent product!
68542	I thought this would be an interesting combo to introduce to my daughter but I've learned that it's hard to convince an 11-mo to eat curry. She doesn't hate it but I can't get her to eat this like the other flavors. Maybe I'll try again when she's older but for now this is not a hit.
109308	This is our second order from Hidden Springs for maple syrup for our B&B.  If they continue with the great price and quick turnaround, not to mention great syrup, we will stay regular customers!
445587	For all you Gluten Free people out there, this is the best buy for the money.  Excellent product.
230069	"It was described to me by a friend and green tea aficionado as """"About the quality of gas station tea in Japan."""" While not as good as the best $2/gram matcha teas I've had, what I can say is that the 30+ brands I've tried from Asian markets around the country (USA) have nothing on Japan's gas stations."
369473	I'm a HUGE fan of Kind bars in general and have tried several varieties. I chose the almond cashew with flax + Omega-3 this time because it was more price friendly than the others. I should have known that you get what you pay for. This was the most unsatisfying Kind bar I've ever had. It's dry and lacks taste. Now I'm stuck with a whole box.
447000	because it contains high fructose corn syrup. and, have looked high and low for a natural alternative. Which I'm now about to order from Amazon! Wholesome Sweeteners corn syrup! After ordering, and receiving, my Wholesome Sweetners corn syrup, I was shocked, and disappointed, that the bottles were so small. A single recipe calling for corn syrup might take more than one bottle! Fortunately, Karo now makes their without HFCS. Which I first noticed at Earth Fare. And, is now available everywhere!
191376	We absolutely love this! My husband begs me to make it at least once or twice a week, and we don't get sick of it. It does have a nice kick, but not enough for our liking so we add extra cumin and chili powder to make it spicier. The flavors are just wonderful though, and it is extremely easy to make. We make it with chicken chunks over rice, delicious! This was my first ever madras sauce, and at first it was different to me because we don't usually eat international foods, but we grew to love it, and even prefer it over pizza night!
